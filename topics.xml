      <text>SAVED FROM VANDALS.
        REGULATIONS CONCERNING YOSEMITE
        NATIONAL PARK.
        An Empire in the Heart of the Sierra
        Nevada—Vandalism of All Kinds
        Prohibited.
        Secretary of the Interior John W. Noble
        has just issued a circular giving various
        rules and regulations for the protection and
        preservation of the Dew National Parks in
        California—the Yosemite and the Sequoia.
        The boundaries of these reservations, con
        taining together considerably over 100,000
        acres, have previously.been published. The
        Yosemite includes portions of Mariposa,
        Tuolumne and Mono counties adjoining
        and surrounding the present Y'osemite
        Park; the other includes all the big-tree
        groves of Tulare county located east of
        Sanger and Visalia. The rules prescribed
        are the same for both reservations. They
        are as follows:
        "The Park by said Acts is placed under
        the exclusive control of the Secretary of
        the Interior, and these rules and regula
        tions are made and published in pursuance
        of the duty imposed ou him in regard
        thereto.
        "No persons other than transient visitors
        will be permitted to be within the Park
        without written authority from the Secre
        tary of the Interior.
        •'No person shall cut, break, remove, im
        pair or interfere with any trees, shrubs,
        plants, timber, minerals, mineral deposits,
        curiosities, wonders, or other objects of in
        terest in the park, and all of the same shall
        be retained in their natural condition.
        'The wanton destruction of the fish and
        game from within the park and their
        capture or destruction for tbe purposes of
        merchandise or profit ore forbidden by said
        Acts; and no one shall carry into or have
        in the park any firearms, traps, nets, tackle
        or appliances, or fish or hunt therein with
        out a license in writing signed by the
        Secretary or Superintendent of the park.
        "No one shall start or kindle, or allow to
        be started or kindled, any fire in grass,
        leaves, underbrush, debris, or dead timber,
        down or standing; and any one so offend
        ing will be held responsible pecuniarily for
        all damages that "may result from such
        fire.
        "The sale or use of intoxicating liquors
        within the park is strictly forbidden.
        "The Superintendent duly appointed by
        the Secretary is hereby authorized and
        directed to remove all trespassers from the
        park, and enforce these rules and regula
        tions and all the provisions of the Acts of
        Congress aforesaid."
        The natural wonders set apart in the new
        Yosemite Park are not generally known.
        The forty-two townships reserved comprise
        1.500 square miles, or over 960,000 acres,
        located on the summit of the Bierra and
        embracing some of the grandest mountain
        scenery in the world. An idea of the size
        of the "new park may be gained by contrast
        ing it with the original Yosemite grant,
        which includes only 30,111 acres. J. M.
        Hutchins, who has lived in the Yosemite
        valley for over thirty years, estimates that
        fullv'7oo,ooo acres of its area are mountain
        ous we! I-watered and heavily timbered.
        The forests comprise pine, spruce, fir, hem
        lock, tamarack, cedar, madrona, laurel, se
        quoia and mountain mahogany. The val
        leys, meadows, lakes and streams make up
        the 350,000 acres remaining.
        Lofty Mount Conness, Mount Hoffmann
        and Mount Lvell are within the new grant;
        as is also the grand canyon of the Tuol
        umne river, including the Hetch-Hetchy
        valley. Wawona, now a stopping place for j
        Yoeemite tourists, is just south of the
        grant The sources of the San Joaquin, j
        the Merced and the Tnolumne rivers, as j
        well as the entire watershed that makes up
        all the present Y'osemite streams, is com
        prised in the great reservation. It is of
        grea* interest to note in connection with
        the above rules that they have no applica
        tion to tbe present Y'osemite grant, which
        remains as it has been, under tbe care of
        our State Commissioners. It is still State
        property, although the new Government
        reservation surrounds it on all sides.
        Secretary Noble, in his circulars, recog
        nizes and favors Y'osemite, not Y'o Semite—
        the old Indian method—as the official des
        ignation ot tbe reservation.

      <text>IT'S SPOLIATION
        So Says Muir of the
        Yosemite.
        CUTTING THE BRUSH.
        Clearing Off and Trimming
        the Trees.
        RANKEST OF MANAGEMENT.
        The Fringe and Bloom Taken off
        the Valley.
        GIVE IT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
        That Is What the Scientist Recom
        mends, as Do Other Lovers of
        the Place.
        (.SEMITE'S friendsaro
        coming to the fore.
        They are crying out
        asr.lnst'the deeds of the
        vandals who Have been
        doing so much to mar
        the beauty of the most
        picturesque valley in
        ■the rid.
        "Spoliation ! Yes,
        that is what it amounts
        'tn." said John Muir, the
        'scientist, yesterday,
        .peaking of tha work that has been going
        on in the Yosemite.
        "Why, 1 tell you that all that is destructi
        ble in the valley has iv great part been
        destroyed," and Mr. Muir brought his hand
        down heavily on a desk in bis library at
        Martinez.
        John Muir, botanist, geologist, traveler
        and litterateur, is perhaps batter acquainted
        with the Yosemite -Valley than any other
        man in California. There is not a spot in
        the valley with which he is not familiar.
        His acquaintance with the Ycstmite dates
        back almost thirty years.
        He lived in the valley a long time and
        made it the ha*.* ol his operations while
        exploring the summits of tbo Sierras, and,
        as one of his anmirers said, "he lingered in
        the Yosemite until he discovered a divinity
        iv every smile ou nature's face in the
        valley."
        Mr. Muir's article in the Century on Ihe
        Yosemite made him an authority on ques
        tions affecting tbe valley.
        ln "Picturesque California" his pen also
        eloquently portrayed the beauties of Cali
        f emir's choicest garden spot.
        "l_eti. r than man living have I loved this
        delightful spot," said Mr. Muir yesterday.
        "Its grandeur and its beauty have ever
        been to me a source of inspiration and d.
        light.
        "Many a night have I slept on the ground
        in the valley without any coveri.g. but the
        sky, ami many a day has my food been
        nothing but dry crumbs of bread while I
        pursued my botanic and geohgic studies.
        "I became part of the nature arou' me,
        and loved it as a brother and a Mend.
        "Mo liapDier hours have I had in my life than
        when I held this communion. For I tell yuu
        there was no mere exquisite piece of natural
        landscape gardening iii the world than the
        lioor of the great Y. Semite Valley.
        "But al! is now changed. Tho floor of
        the valley ._ now a cow pasturage and cor
        rals.
        "The idealistic features and dclica'e orna
        mentation of the valley «re thing, of the
        past. The Sne blot m has been nipped off,
        the >aiit;ful wild gardens have been
        trampled upon and destroyed,
        "Sheep and hogs and cows have eaten uu
        the liiies and azaltas and briar roses, whose
        bloom; fragrance and blossoms made the
        valley such a beautiful garden,
        "When one looked from the frowning
        cliffs at the grand falls some years ago his
        fcot trod upon some flower thut emitted a
        fragrance. New he is likely to step into a
        sheep or cow trail that takes all the eeuti
        niei.t out of the view.
        • "Never was beauty so marred as in this
        vallcj." -
        "To what do you attribute this spolia
        tion?"
        '•The fringe and polish and ornamental
        finish of the valley have been destroyed in
        great part," was the answer, "not ma
        liciously, but through ignorance and incom
        petence. All that is destructible has in
        great part been destroyed. The indestruct
        ible p*rt of the valley is still there because
        tlie cl ; fTs and fails and mountains of the
        Yosemite can never be destroyed. But the
        delicate tracing of nature's hand, which
        cave tone and beauty to the whole, like the
        setting to the gem or the frame to the
        picture, is no more.
        "The marring of this beautiful spot can
        be laid to no other cause than the mis
        management of the Commissioners who
        have n:.d charge of the affairs of the valley.
        There can be no question about this mis
        management It is too palpable and the
        condition of the valley speak, for itself.
        Ax and plow and horses have long been and
        are still busy in the Ytsemite's gardens and
        groves.
        "All that is accessible and destructible Is
        being rapidly destroyed — more rapidly than
        in any other valley in the Sierra?, though
        this is the only one that is under the special
        protection of the Government.
        "The greater patt of this destruction of
        the fineness of trio wilderness in the valley
        is of a kind that can claim no right relation
        ship with what necessarily follows use.
        "In the first place there has been no con
        sistency of plan in tha treatment of the
        valley.
        *'The Commissioners have beeu as vacillat
        ing and changeable as the moon. One year
        it is one thing in the way of alleged im
        provement, and another year it is some
        thing else before the first undertaking has
        been oompletepl. The result is the destruc
        tion of the fine picturesqueness of the valley.
        "I do not say that the Commissioners have
        done these things with the intention to mar
        the vsiliey nd destroy its beauties. The
        result is due to their incompetence and lack
        cf arti «t;c .'acuities.
        "Just look bow the 'improvements' are
        mad  The Commissioners take a junket
        ing trip up to Ike Y.psemite. After a fine
        dinner, wiih wine, they sit OB the veranda
        of t'i- hotel. ■ _£p_
        " 'That bin over there should be cleared
        away,' _ays one.
        '"Let's chop down those trees' says an
        other.
        "Forthwith both jobs are done. 'People
        should be able to view the falls from the
        hotel. 1 will save them trouble.' rays an
        other, and the work of clearing away and
        destroying the fringe oa tba floor of the val
        ley goes on.
        "Besides the cows and horses and sheep,
        the fires ol campers have also done wanton
        destruction, ln tho Yellowstone Park,
        which is under the National Government, a
        camper who does not put out bis fire is
        henvily fined. _
        "Mounted patrolmen see that this law is
        enforced. The Yosemite Commissioners
        have been indifferent on this subject and
        considerable ruin from these campers' fires
        have been the result.
        "What the Commissioners should have
        done years ego would have been to have
        employed a systematic method of dealing
        with improvements in the valley instead ot
        changing their plan and policy with each
        year.
        "They should have obtained the services
        of a .killed and expert landscape gardener,
        and let all improvements be under his su
        pervision.
        "Then all this destruction could have
        been averted. There can be no intelligent
        and DSeful administration of affairs in the
        valley unless improvements are directed by
        an expert landscape gardener who will see
        that a systematic and artistic plan is pur
        sued in the work.
        "Another instance of the mismanagement
        nf the Commissioners," continued Mr. Muir,
        "is seen in the way a monopoly controls all
        rights and privileges in the valley.
        "Horses are allowed to pasture, and trees
        ana bushes are cut down at libeity,
        "Visitors are fleeced and charged hich
        prices for everything. This should not be
        allowed.
        "Again, the commission is generally the
        creation of political influences. While this
        continues the members will always be in
        some way dominated by outside interests.
        Poli'.ics have had more to do with the spoli
        ation and ruination of the valley than any
        other cause."
        "Are you lo favor of the National Govern
        ment resuming control of the Yosemite?"
        "Most emphatically I am." was the an
        swer of Mr. Muir. "I am, as president of the
        Sierra Society, at present working for the
        recession of the Yosemite to the Federal
        Government.
        "This would stop the mismanagement,
        take tho valley out of politics. Insure Intel
        ligent and artistic improvements, and give
        nature a chance to recoup herself In restor
        ing the delicate tracery of bloom and blos
        som to tbe valley.
        "You ask how this restoration to the
        national Government can be accomplished.
        Wei!, there ere two plans which are being
        considered. The first one is the iotroduc
        lion of a bill in the State Legislature abol
        ishing the Yosemite Commission a.d re
        storing tbe rights of the State. v.. icb are
        oniy held in trust to the Federal Govern
        ment. It is hardly thought that this plan
        can work this season.
        "Another plan is to hold an Investigation
        ,and produce testimony as to the misman
        agement by the Commissioners of the affairs
        of the valley. After mismanagement is
        proved the idea is to have a bill Introduced
        in Congress, declaring that owing to this
        iipism>* . .ge:..t.,i the State of California lias
        violated the trust under 'which she holds
        the valley, and to have the grant declared
        forfeited, the reversion going to the Fed
        eral Government,
        "While 1 am on this subj.cl. let me say
        a word about tie Caminetti bill, widen
        ha. in view the restriction and contraction
        of our great national pleasure grounds in
        the Vi semitp.
        "This bill provides forthe restriction of
        the Yo-emitP national park's present
        boundaries in the interest of sneer-men and
        lumbermen, although it does not say so.
        Caminetti wants to reduce it nearly one
        half, hut will have to make a hard fight to
        accomplish his end.
        "Should his boundaries be adopted, sheep
        j would get on the headwaters of the
        Tuolumne River, and the Yosen^e V.i ley
        I would be at their mercy." Cammetti also
        1 desires to exclude soufo of the finest forests
        lon the western boundary. The bill should
        j. c defeated.
        "He says that there are seventy-five far
        mers in the valley who desire the bound.
        res curtailed. I Know the sentiment of tho
        liners in the valley as well a- any one.
        ] ri the Bret place, there are cot . evemy-flye
        oi them, but only about six, and I bay wish
        ll _ boundaries to be r.s ot present, because
        tbey keep out the sheep from eating their
        Kress and keep ax. ay the destructive tires
        and smoko of the lumbermen, who, besides
        destroying the forests, also ruin the very
        skyjof the valley with their dust and smoke.
        fill that 1 have spoken to say they want
        to [bo ii the park so as to be protected from
        lb* sheepmen whose large flocks sweep off
        every blade of grass from the small farms.
        "Secretary Noble is in favor of reserving
        all 0'- the western shed of the Sierras, with
        its e.ts. to he managed by the Federal
        Govpinmcnt. I am in accord with his
        vie---*. In this great western shed there
        at tether places almost as grand as the
        Yosi.mite Itself, along the Little Fork and
        Kings 'Stiver for instance.
        "A^present we have the State managing
        the Yosemite Valley, which is entirely
        surrounded by the boundaries of the Na
        tional Yosemite Park, under the control of
        the Frtleral Government. This appears to
        be 1 .. ulous. It i«, however, another ar
        gunienl for the State to givo up the Yo
        semite Valley, which has in recent years
        been so badly mismanaged owing to a lack
        of ex .rt and skilled artistic administration.
        '"So bad has been this mismanagement
        that the door of the valley has been turned
        into a common wayside pasture, while
        there Ijju* been no appreciation whatever by
        the Commissioners of the flue dress and
        delicatpj flora of the park.
        "1 be|ie -e that nine-tenths of the people
        of the Ktate of California are in favor of tho
        reservation of the Yos. init.s of the Sierras.
        Those only are opposed who have pecuniary
        inter-- . fnvolved. TJcfortunately the lat
        ter hav c united and are willing to spend
        capital t 0 olbtaia tbeir land..
        "If the lovers of the beautiful in nature
        want to, tight this combination they will
        have to organize themselves and present a
        formidable front to the enemy."

      <text>JOHN MUIR ON YOSEMITE
        The Mountaineer and Writer
        Says That the Valley Is
        Wrecked.
        "DOWNTRODDEN AND DESOLATE"
        He Tells What He Saw and Wants the
        Government to Take Back the
        Valley.
        The opinions and declarations of John
        Muir will cat a good deal of a figure in
        the promised controversy over the ways
        oi the Yosemite Commissioners regarding
        the valley and the proposition to cede the
        valley back to the National Government,
        and Mr. Muir is anxious to start a cam
        paign to carry out that proposition, as
        well as to secure further protection for the
        National parks and big timber reservations
        of the Sierras.
        The familiarity of the president of the
        Sierra Club with the situation regarding
        these things and the unselfishness of his
        motives will hardly be denied by any who
        differ from him. He has no personal
        quarrel with the commission or any one
        else. He spent a large part of this sum
        mer exploring the Yosemite and other re
        gions, includine the Hetchy Hetchy Val
        ley, the headwaters of the Tuolumne and
        so on, finding out how the splendid reser
        vations were being cared for, neglected or
        destroyed, and he has come home with
        some important ideas which he vigorously
        expresses.
        As to the Yosemite, he says that it has
        become a frowsy, barren waste through
        the destruction of the luxuriant and un
        equaled natural growths and bloom of the
        valley floor as the result of neglect and tiie
        lack of intelligent care and adequate pro
        tection. He wants the valley tuken out of
        small politics and given to the care of a
        power that will intelligently plan and
        effectively execute what is needed to pre
        serve the incomparable valley as the gar
        den of gardens which nature made it.
        Last Saturday Mr. Muir told what he
        knew and thought of the Yosemite Val
        ley, and this is what John Muir said:
        "" During a recent summer tour of the
        Yosemite National Park which lasted spv
        eral weeks I especially observed its condi
        tion as a result of its care and protection
        by the military authorities for the lasc
        three years and contrasted it with the con
        dition of the forest reservations to the
        south of the park and with the Yosemite
        Valley.
        "The contrast effectively demonstrates
        not only the propriety, but the necessity,
        I might venture to say, of extending the
        military authority over not only the forest
        reservations, but also over the Yosemite
        Valley, which is within the bounds of the
        wonderful beautiful park, and naturally
        forms a part of it, if its wonderful beauty
        is to be preserved and made available for
        the enjoyment of the world.
        "The care of the National reservation by
        the military has been a complete success.
        I was delighted to find that .since the cav
        alry have successfully kept out the sheep
        and prevented destructive tires the forests
        are taking on their old beauty and gran
        deur. Before the cavalry gave protection
        the door of the forest whs naked as a cor
        ral and utterly desolate. Now, with the
        restoration of ttie carpet of flowers, grasses
        and other pmall undergrowths, it is like
        a garden in the fineness and richness of
        its beauty. The streams now Mow clear
        again in their bloom-bordored channels,
        the lilies ring their bells around the
        margins of the meadows, and the whole
        blessed region is an inspiration and joy.
        "On the contrary the lorest reservations
        are still being overrun with sheep, and are
        as dusty, bare and desolate as ever they
        were, notwithstanding the Government
        notices posted along the trails forbidding
        the pasturing of sheep, cattle, etc., under
        JOHN MUIE, A CHAMPION OF YOSEMITE.
        [From a photograph.]
        severe penalties, simply because there is
        no one on the ground to enforce the rules.
        One soldier, armed with a gun and the
        authority of the Government, is more
        effective than any number of paper warn
        ings.
        "The only downtrodden, dusty, frowsy
        looking part of the Sierra within the boun
        daries of the National Park, with the ex
        ception of a few cattle ranches, is the
        Yosemite, whicli ought to be the gem of
        the whole, the garden of all the gardens of
        the park. Whfen I first saw the valley its
        whole floor, sever, miles long by about
        a half to three-quarters of a mile wide, was
        one charming park, delicately beautiful,
        divided into groves, meadows and flower
        gardens. The vegetation was exceedingly
        luxuriant and had a charmingly delicate
        quality of bloom that was contrasted with
        tne grandeur of the granite walls
        "This beauty, so easily injured, has in
        great part vanished through lack of ap
        preciative care, through making the finest
        meadows into haynelds and giving up all
        the rest of theiloorof the valley to pastures
        for the saddle animals kept for the use of
        tourist?, and also for the animals belonging
        to campers. Each year the number of
        campers increases, and of course destruc
        tive trampling and hacking becomes
        heavier from season to season. Camping
        parties on their arrival in the valley are re
        quired to report to i.he guardian, to regis
        ter and have camp-grounds assigned them,
        ana their attention is called to the rules
        and regulations of the valley prohibiting
        the cutting of trees, underbrush, etc.. but
        as the guardian has no power to enforce
        the rules— has not a single policeman under
        him— tney are of non-effect, or nearly so.
        Most campers and tourists seem to appre
        ciate their privileges, but some, I'm sorry
        to say, appear to need a soldier as much as
        the sheep-owners who break over the
        boundaries of the park.
        "The grander attractions of Yosemite —
        its cliffs and waterfalls— will always draw
        admiring travelers from every country, no
        matter what becomes of its tine groves and
        gardens; but fewer will come, and of those
        who do few will remain long, while their
        enjoyments of these wonders will be far
        less after the vegetation is destroyed. How
        many people would go to Del Monte by
        the sea and how long would they stay were
        its lawns and gardens trodden into barren
        sand and dust? The only places where
        the wild plants of the valley can now be
        found in all their beauty are up on the
        benches and in hidden recesses of the walls
        that are not accessible to animals. The
        idea of turning the world's Yosemite Val
        ley into a pasture and hayfield, and at the
        same time holding it 'for public use, re?ort
        and recreation, inalienable for all time!'
        "Not a single horse or cow should be al
        lowed to eatTand trample the flora of the
        valley. It was given to the State for a
        higher use. Hay and grain in abundance
        can be hauled into the valley and sold to
        the owners of the saddle-trains and to
        campers at moderate prices at stables and
        corrals provided by the commission.
        Then, of course, every disfiguring
        fence would be useless and the
        wild vegetation would be gradually
        restored. ~ Since the running fires have
        been kept out of the valley the underbrush
        requires much expensive attention, but this
        work should be done under the direction
        of a landscape artist — for haphazard, un
        skilled grubbing in these gardens will not
        do. The banks of the river wasted by
        spring floods also require attention, and
        the roads need sprinkling during the visit
        ing season, etc. But all this requires con
        siderable appropriations by the Legisla
        ture, and, judging by past experience, will
        not be easily obtained. As far as the hotel
        and saddle-train management is con
        cerned but little fault can be found. The
        charges are reasonable, everything consid
        ered, but the valley itself is rapidly going
        from bad to worse.
        "It seems to me that the way to secure
        competent and proper management is to
        take the valley out of politics. It is regu
        lated by State Commissioners appointed
        by the Governor, some of which no doubt
        are to some extent political creditors.
        Perhaps most of them mean well, but they
        don't know how and don't hold their
        offices long enough to learn. It is the sys
        tem that is wrong. The board is changed
        constantly, and if one board acquired
        some knowledge and adopted a policy they
        would not have time to curry it into effect
        before a new set of politicians would be
        in. The Commissioners differ all around
        as to what to do and how to do it, and
        there can be no permanent and competent
        policy carried out under the present plan.
        Then the commission has small appropria
        tions to use. and this is largely because
        the people don't care what becomes of the
        valley or are not confident that money ap
        propriated would be applied to the best
        advantage.
        "The solution of the whole question, it
        seems to me, is to re-cede the valley to the
        Federal Government and let it form a part
        of the Yosemite National Park, which nat
        urally it is. It is the heart and gem of it,
        and should at least receive as much care
        and protection as the park surrounding.
        If the valley were returned to the control
        of the United States Government, it would
        be under the care of the military depart
        ment, which would rigidly carry out all
        rules and regulations, reeardless of ever
        shifting politics and small plans of inter
        ested parties for" private gains. One man
        agement is enough, and management on
        the Government basis would be better than
        one ever fluctuating with the political
        pulse. If that were done, the State would
        not be called upon for a dollar. Nearly all
        the members of the Sierra Club with whom
        I have talked favor putting an end to this
        political management. Only those people
        pecuniarily interested in roads, franchises
        and other little jobs are opposed to it, as
        far as I have found out, though even those
        would he benefited by the change through
        increase of travel. This, I am strongly
        convinced, is the right way, and the only
        one that will secure for the valley the pro
        tection, regulation and restoration it so
        badly needs.
        "It gave me exceeding pleasure to find
        that people were going to the valley and
        the mountain regions about it in rapidly
        increasing numbers. I found this year 100
        people in the mountains to where one was
        to be found ten years ago, and was sur
        prised and pleased to find now and then
        companies of girls, some being parties of
        sixteen and twenty, tramping merrily
        along with the sparkle and exhilaration of
        the mountains in their eyes, attended by
        wagons carrying their outfits. People
        should be encouraged to go to the moun
        tains in summer to enjoy the blessings
        there.
        "This is the main object of the Sierra
        Club, and to its influence a part of this
        remarkable increase of mountain travel
        may, I think, be fairly ascribei. It is en
        couraging to know that there is a new gen
        eration springing up in California that is
        looking lor enjoyment apart from money
        making. People are finding out that tbere
        is health, enjoyment and inspiration there.
        Tbe\ r can at least breathe pure air twenty
        four hours a day, a:id that is much even to
        a blind man."

      <text>A PICTURE OF OUR SITUATION.
        Our contemporaries who run with the
        Buckley crowd object to any arrangement
        by which the Influence of that association
        of desperadoes may ix* curtailed. In this
        Connection we notice that Senator Hearst's
        paper is displeased with the bill for the en
        largement of tho Yosemite Park grant,
        -which, it is urged, contemplates placing its
        control under the general Government. Of
        course not, for tins would interfere with
        pome of the patronage of that class of dep
        redators. The Examiner in noticing Mr.
        Yanuever's bill says:
        Tb- centralizing tendencies now dominant at
        Washington are well Illustrated In Mr. Vande
        vet's hill enlarging tlie Yosemite gram and plac
        ing the whole reservation under national con
        tiol. The fact that Mr. Yaudever Is supposed to
        represent tie State of dlilornla has no effect
        upon bis actions. He would probably be glad to
        sre Ibe Federal Government lake bold of our lo
        cal elections, manage our public schools and
        regulate the pay of our policemen aud the li
        cence of our saloons.
        There are many persons in this city who
        t'io not believe in permitting the Buckley
        crowd to run the city and State. These
        desperadoes are doing more than is good
        fur the well-being of the public. Indeed,
        the people have seen how taxes are increas
        ing under this . regime, and they nre not
        please. l even with judges and juries who
        .are virtually controlled by Buckley's lambs.
        -What can we expect from judges who are
        nominated by such influences? And jurors
        who are selected by the men placed in office
        -through such a combination cannot be re
        lied on. The Examiner says further:
        Undoubtedly a chauge Is needed in the man
        .-l'iemeut of Ike Yosemite. But the change can
        .lie mad - ivi lion*, announcing to the world that
        we are unfit to he trusted with the cure of a
        natural masterpiece. There is bo reason why
        'vi people ol tins State, who know the Yosemite
        1 etler ■ ban any oilier and take moie pride In It
        - than any others, nhouid not he as compeieut to
        evulrol its management as the people of Florida
        and -•: id-lean.
        ._ Can any management be worse than one
        j which is under such a regime as that which
        - governs San Francisco and toe State of
        California nt present? It is believed that
        . schemes are carried through the municipal
        government by the. direct use of money. It
        is also believed that the State, is plundered
        iii the same way. If we elect a United
        States Senator it is said from one extremity
        if tic Union to another that the position
        lias been bought with money. We have, in
        fact, become a byword because we permit a
        lew in. to sell us outright. Our own
        . citizens are by no means ignorant in respect
        to ■ the disgraceful position . which San
        Francisco occupies, for it is talked about
        * vi- mi the corners of the streets. The
        city cannot stand such a rule for much
        length of time as that which we are having.
        The miner says Mr. Vandever "would
        probably be glad to see the Federal Gov
        . ernment take hold of our local elections,"
        etc. Perhaps Sir. Vandever believes a
        ..change by which the election machinery in
        this city and State could be taken out of the
        hands of Buckley and his associates would
        be of advantage to the people. We cer
        tainly believe under present conditions
        that our citizens cannot have an honest
        „ election, for the ba'.lot-boxes are placed
        under the control of men in whom the pub
        lic, have little or no confidence. And the
        polling-places are frequently located in
        ro.pms where the counting of the ballots
        - cannot be watched. . . The Call, however,
        is in favor of searching for Californians
        who can be trusted to manage oar city and
        State affairs but we nre free to say that
        the Yosemite Park had better be under the
        ■ control of United States officials than uuder
        the Buckley crowd.

        Hendrye and Plumbe were the principal magnets for the crowd and each was struck on different
        parts of the body at least a dozen times. No attempt was made to run cars to-night. In an
        inter view the Sheriff said: "I will have no further interference on the part of Mayor
        Mulvahill. j I will have 100 'special men here to-morrow and will do my best to preserve
        peace, and if the Mayor, or any. one else interferes he will be stopped; if necessary I will
        supersede Mayor Mulvahill in authority." Officials of the Trolley Company will not reveal
        the names of the men injured. It Is positively known, however, that not a man of the twelve
        who were on the six cars escaped injury of some kind. Every one of them as they stood on the
        platform of their cars while going into;the barns was seen to be bleeding profusely from the
        head and face. In addition to the trolley men injured, Roadmaster Davis of the Trolley-
        Company, was severely injur ed by which struck him on tne head. V--' . ;,^V,y' .T-' ;

        stationed at the car barns were entirely urable to cope with the mob and he sent for Chief
        Coffin of the fire department. After a short consultation the latter or dered out Engine
        Company No. 6 and a line of hosei Superintendent Bingham also ordered every man to
        co-operate with the firemen and finally the mob slowly fell back before the water. One . of
        the strike breakers was assisting the firemen in' holding the hose when a well directed
        brick hit him on the head and knocked him to the ground senseless. . When the mob had
        dispersed the fire men and extra policemen were ordered back to their quarters and the
        regular detailed force guarded the barns. FIREMEN ARE CALLED OUT. When the last car had
        passed in the doors, there were 4000 persons gathered in a vacant lot opposite and violence

        the barns and anything that belonged to the company in the viclnitv. In the meantime stone*
        were flying in a "shower and one struck Mayor Mulvahill on the head; bruising it badly. The
        two Sheriffs jumped on the car and told the motorman to proceed to thej carsheds, a quarter
        of a mile distant. The bombard ment did. not abate and the crowds on the street were so
        thick that the motor man had to go slowly. The stone throw ing soon became so furious that
        the Sheriffs drew their revolvers and fired five shots into the air. This caused a slight
        cessation in the bombardment and the car reached the barns and was run in side. The five

          Railway and Lighting Company, to run its
          cars with non-union men to-day resulted
          in a* riot, in which at least fifty men
          were injured:, The Sheriff says that an
          other such outbreak would make the call

E. T. Parsons Tells Members of the Sierra Club
Why One of California' s Glories Should l
          Be Kept for Joy of the Generations
          That Are Yet to Come
          the following trenchant nummary of
          the vital question* Involved In the
          fletcli lletchy controversy was presented
          to the Sierra club of California at a

          day evening. Mr. Parsons,, who id one
          of the directors of the club, of which
          John Mulr Is president, has made a
          thorough and searching study of the
          question, and brings a powerful argument
          against the destruction of the national
          , park. ' :' f.
          BY. K. T. PARSONS
'•The original proponent of the tak
ing of the Hetch Hetchy valley and the
Tuolumne water shed—over half of the
Yosemite National park—for a watei
system for San Francisco and other
apologies for this unnecessary intru
sion of local interests into a national
property, have voiced and published
from time to time various misstate
mtmts to support their contentions.
The writer agrees with those San
Franciscans who believe that a supply
of water from the Sierra Nevada is de
sirable, but who. In view of the many
other possible Sierra sources, cannot
concede that it is necessary or right to
destroy the greatest features of our
unrivaled national park, and replies to
those who shut their eyes tp other pos
sible sources as follows:
"Let us emphasize two foremost
1 impositions in the minds of those who
Delieve that the Yosemite National
park should be preserved:
"The Yosemite National park was
created to preserve the Hetch Hetchy
valley, the grand canyon of the Tuo
lumne, and the Tuolumne meadows
torn destructive invasion and as a
public park for resort and recration. If
this had not been done the Hetch
tetchy water system would long since
have passed into private ownership
and would be no more available for the
use of San Francisco than any of the
dozen other sources that will furnish
an adequate supply for San Francisco.
The privote rights that would have
existed would have cost her untold mil-
lious.
"This is best expressed in the lan
guage of R. U. Johnson of the Century
magazine: ' Let us say at once that
          we hold human life more sacred than
          scenery, than even great natural won
          derlands, vastly as they contribute to
          save life and promote happiness; and
          if that were the point at issue, if San
          Francisco could not otherwise obtain
          an abundant water supply we should
          be willing to dedicate to that purpose
          not only Hetch Hetchy but even the
          incomparable Yosemite itself.'
Other Available Sources
"The first question that arises in the
mind of every practical man is wheth
er there are any other sources avail
able and, if so, what would be their
comparative cost. That there are oth
er sources in the Sierra not even the
city' s advocates will deny, for they
          testified before the senate committee
          that 'there are no less than half a
dozen water supplies from the Sierras."
That there is not -sufficient information
now available upon which to base an
opinion as to the comparative merits
of the various Sierra sources is the
Judgment of one of the city' s eminent
          experts. Professor Marx. There are,
          however, several systems that in the
          matter of cost and amount and purity
          of water will compare favorably with
          the Hetch Hetchy project.
          The Stanislaus Source
"One of these, the Stanislaus, is
brushed lightly aside by one of the
city's advocates, who quotes from cer
tain testimony in the senate record to
prove his point. The testimony quoted
purports to establish the fact that
there is no reservoir site below the
tail-race of the Stanislaus Power com
pany sufficient to reservoir the water
of the Stanislaus river for the city of
San Francisco. Any person qualified
to discuss the subject of water supply
must know that a reservoir at the
point mentioned Is utterly unnecessary.
All that would be required is a mere
diversion dam, which can be con
structed in a score of places below the
tail-race.
As Much Interested as San Francisco
" The Stanislaus Power company Is
          as vitally interested in storing suffi
          cient water in reservoirs above the
          tall-race and in equalizing the flow of
          the river as would San Francisco. A
          continuous maximum flow of water
          is essential to the successful opera
          tion of the power plant. The power
          company has already constructed dams
          and in the future will construct
          others so as to store a quantity of
          water in excess of that which can be
          stored in Hetch Hetchy valley. How
          simple, then, to divert this continuous
          flow of water that has already been
          reservoired, pipe It into the San Fran
          gtsco peninsula reservoirs, and use It
          for a municipal supply. The power
          rights above the tail-race are held in
          private ownership, it is true, but the
          generation of electric power does not
          consume the water in some mysterious
          way as the assertions of certain of the
          Hetch Hetchy advocates would lead us
          to believe. Until the water Itself i»
          actually put to some beneficial use It
          cannot be subjected to private owner
          ship and others prevented from
          using it.
          The Preferred Rights Problem
"Tho rights along the Stanislaus
river below the power company's tall
race are few and of minor import
ance. The rights on the Stanislaus do
not begin to compare in importance
with the private rights that already
have attached on the Tuolumne river
below Hetch Hetchy. One billion, five
hundred million gallons per day of
natural flow has been guaranteed the
Turlock and Modesto irrigation dis
tricts by the city of San Francisco,
not to mention the right to augment
this natural flow by .storage, which
right of storage is only limited by
available reservoir sites. Since the
recent decision of Miller  Lux vs.
Madera Water company, the city will
have to condemn all the riparian
rights on the Tuolumne which, the su
preme court hns held, attach to flood
water* as well as to minimum flow.
These are much more important on
the Tnolumne than on the Stanislaus,
where there is a greater rainfall and
a less area of irrigable lands. The
Stanislaus company once offered to
Imlld a complete transmission system
and deliver to the city of San Fran
cisco for actual cost, plus 10 pen cent,
a maximum supply of water equal to
any possible requirements, and to
guarantee all titles under satisfactory
bond.
Cost About the Same
" Wo can reasonably assume that the
          cost of the Stanislaus project would be
          about the tame as the Hetch Hetchy,
          and if anything would be slightly less.
          In actual distance the Stantsiaus
          project would appear to have a slight
          advantage over the Hetch Hetchy. The
          Stanislaus river heads in a granite
          country similar in Its characteristics to
          the Tuolumne, and is protected by a
          forest reservoir. A former supervisor
          of San Francisco, who favors the
          Flitch Hetchy scheme, when asked
          what he thought of the Stanislaus
          source, said: "We never investigated
it and never will.'
" Why do the proponents of this in
          vasion of the. Tosemite National park
          persistently Ignore other sources?
"Mr. Marsden Manson, city engineer
of San Francisco, in a recent article
said of the Stanislaus that it is 'ade
quate in afea, with pure water, sub
ject tv> slight contamination,' and his
only stated objection is that it is con
trollod by a company engaged in the
development of hydro-electric power as
above noted. I am informed by one
of the company's representatives that
there is a sufficient surplus of power
to satisfy all of San Francisco's needs
and that this power could be obtalnec
for little more than cost. When we
consider the saving in cost of con
struction of dams and installation o
power plnnts. we can readily see that
this system is entirely feasible. More
over, unquestionably there will be
more contamination In the Tuolumne
watershed, above the Hetch Hetchy
valley, than in the Stanislaus system
The Eel River Supply
"Another possible source for San
Francisco that never has- received a
complete and exhaustive Investigation,
but which the data now available
tend strongly to indicate, will Cost
much less fhan the Hetch Hetchy
project, is the south fork of the Eel
river. The Snow Mountain Power and
Water company already has diverted
the flow of thin river through a tunnel
which is of sufficient capacity to con
vey 150,000,000 gallons daily and al
lows the water to escape into the Rus
sian river after generating power.
Three hundred and twenty-eight
square miles of water shed, subject to
a very heavy precipitation, are tribu
tary to the projected Gravelly valley
reservoir. With a dam only 150 feet
In height, this reservoir will store
9,357,000,000 cubic feet, or about 70,
--000,000,000 gallons, being a greater stor
age capacity than the Hetch Hetchy
site wtih a 250-foot dam. One thou
sand four hundred feet of drifts have
already been run in testing the "bed
rock foundation for this dam. A hun
dred-foot dam will be erected suffi
cient to impound water for 150,000,000
gallons daily flow and probably com
pleted by the fall of 1910.
"There is only one house of perma
nent habitation on this entire water
shea above the reservoir, together with
half a dozen shanties used by hunters
In the shooting season. The site of
present dwellings at Hullville will be
flooded and the buildings removed.
The entire watershed is protected by
the national forest reserve.
Water Running to Waste
"At present the water conducted
through the above mentioned tunnel
escapes into the Russian river, flows
down the natural channel, and is run
ning to waste In the ocean. It can be
diverted near Cloverdale after being
filtered through extensive natural
gravel beds that exist in that vicinity.
The water can then be taken in a pipe
line and run by gravity along near
the Northwestern Pacific railroad
grade to tide water on San Pablo bay.
The distance would be less than two
thirds of the length of the proposed
Hetch Hetchy line, and being a grav
ity system running close to a railroad
would mean an enormous saving in
cost of pipe line and transportation of
materials necessary for construction.
The crossing of San Pablo bay by a
knuckle joint pipe like that used by
Spring valley at Dunbartdn Point
crossing would be a simple matter and
small expense compared with the
crossing of the San Joaquln valley
and the pumping over the coast range
at Altamont, as would have to be done
tn the case of the Hetch Hetchy sys
tem. This knuckle Joint pipe, as de
vised by Mr. Schussler, has been in
use twenty years. It has been dragged
by ships' anchors and withstood earth
quakes, and it is still in good condition.
"A. M. Hunt, an eminent engineer,
has estimated that 60,000,000 gallons
a day can be brought to San Francisco
from this source for approximately
$12,000,000, or a little more than a third
of what the city engineer has esti
mated it would cost to bring ih the
same amount from the Hetch Hetchy
system. The amount of water can be
Increased to 15,000,000 gallons per day
when the Gravelly valley dam is com
pleted and to 200,000,000 gallons per day
when required by raising this dam.
All danger of contamination Is effec
tually eliminated by the filtering above
mentioned. This is an ideal and cheap
source for Berkeley, Oakland and Ala
meda, since tho pipe line could be
brought through these cities on Its
way to the San Francisco peninsula
reservoirs.
Another Possible Source
"There are other projects that have
been favorably mentioned by eminent
engineers. For example, the waters of
the San Joaquin river could be pumped
from the proposed crossing of the river
by the Hetch Hetchy 3ystem and all
the expense of head works and dam
construction and length of pipe line
from head works to the San Joaquln
river eliminated. This would result In
the saving of more than $10,000,000.
There would have to be offset against
this the cost of power for pumping
over the coast range and the cost of
filtration, but there would result a
much less expensive source of supply.
It should be remembered that water
properly filtered is the safest for a
municipality to use, and the day is not
far distant when all self-respecting
communities will recognize this fact.
For the filtration of a supply so ob
tained there Is available in the city's
present system a great reservoir, the
base of which is an enormous gravel
bed, through which as a natural filter
200,000.000 gallons dally could be
passed.

supplies are Lake Merced, Pilarcltas,
San Andreas and Crystal springs, Por

"It is doubtful whether any city in
the world of her size has more avail
able sources than has San Francisco.
Eminent hydraulic engineers have in
dorsed many of the foregoing propo
sitions.
Far-Reaching Precedent Involved
"If this needless and destructive
right to flood the Hetch Hetchy valley
is granted to San Francisco, the pre
cedent that would be established would
shake the very foundation of the
whole national park policy. Thereafter
r.o national park, however great and
wonderful, would be safe from despolia
tion, for thia Instance would be point
ed out as an example where the na
tion had sanctioned a most destruc
tive trespass upon one of the greatest
scenic wonders of the world.
"It is difficult to convey to those
who have not visited it an adequate
idea of the importance and grandeur of
our great national park. Most persons
confuse it with the Yosemito valley,
whereas that portion of the park em
bracing the Tuolumne watershed is by
far the finer half. This portion of the
park includes the Hetch Hetchy val
ley, the grand canyon of the Tuolumne
and the Tuolumne meadows.
One of the Greatest Canyons
"The grand conyon of the Tuolumne
is one of the greatest and most stu
pendous canyons in the world. Let
anyone take a topographic map of the
Tosemite quadrangle and one of the
grand canyon of the Colorado and comp
are them. He will find that in the
case of the grand canyon of the Colo
rado there Is a vertical drop of nearly
SCOO feet from the hotel on the rim
of the canyon to the river at the bot
tom. But this is in a horizontal dis
tance of two miles. There are places
In the Tuolumne canyon, however,
where there is a vertical depth of al
most 5000 feet in a horizontal distance
of one mile. While the Tuolumne
canyon lacks some of the sculpturing
and coloration which the Colorado can
yon possesses, it has other charms
which are none the less attractive and
wonderful. Spires, domes, castellated
promontories, lace-lake waterfalls,
pouring over sheer walls of dizzy
height, the mighty, thundering cas
cades of the river with their 'water
wheels, 1 which cannot be matched even
in the Yosemite, and a hundred les
ser charms of forest and flowery mead
ow. All this drains directly into the
Hetch Hetchy valley, and Is not sep
arated from it by a distance of twen
ty miles, as one of our opponents would
have us believe, but Is a part of those
twenty miles. While now somewhat
inaccessible, except to the hardy
climber, it can easily be made ac
cessible at not a great expense, and
in time the government undoubtedly
will make it so.
The Tuolumne Meadow*
"Then Just above and on the same
river are the Tuolumne meadows. Pro
fessor Joseph Le Conte, the late emi
nent scientist, described them as a
'beautiful grassy plain of great ex
tent, thickly enameled with flowers
and surrounded with the most mag
nificent Bcenery To anyone wishing
really to enjoy* camp life among the
high Sierras, I know of no place more
delightful The scenery ig no
where more glorious.'
"When we keep In mind the fact that
John Muir, Stewart Edward White and
others who have camped in all parts
of America, and, In fact, the world,
agree that our Sierra is the finest camp
ground of them all, we can commence
to gain some faint Idea of what this
means.
The Artificial Lake Idea
"The city's advocates say that dam
ming the Hetch Hetchy will make a
beautiful lake of It and enhance the
scenery. It ought to be sufficient an
swer to say that John Muir, William
Keith and those who know the valley
best deny this. It Is sophistry invented
to mislead the uninformed. Camping or
living on the floor of the valley or
anywhere in the Immediate vicinity
would be rendered Impossible and one
of the great scenic camping grounds
in the park absolutely destroyed. This
fact has been overlooked. Five thou
sand people could be accommodated
In the Hetch Hetchy .valley In camps
and hotels. This Is also true only of
the Tuolumne meadows and Yosemite.
"The state road from Mono county Is
now built up the eastern slope of the
Sierra and was recently completed to
its connection with the old Tioga min
ing road, and will be one of the great
highways of travel across the Sierra,
which will pass through these mead
ow's and cross the main river. It is
certain that any one of the other avail
able sources, all of which are pro
tected by forest reserve, will be sub
ject to leas liability of contamination
than will the Tuolumne supply with
the constantly increasing travel
througout its source in the Yosemito
national park.
Congressional Action
"The public lands committee of the
house of representatives was evenly
divided In its report on this use of the
Hetch Hetchy after the hearing during
the last session. The chairman of the
committee prepared an adverse report
which was Higned by four others. In
which he said:
" 'I am of the opinion that the city
has failed to establish Its contention
that the Hetch Hetchy la the only rea
eonaly available source, of water sup
ply in the Sierras, and that, therefore,
the interests of the people of all the
country should be waived on behalf of
San Francisco In its claim to the ex
clusive use of this valley.'
"A majority of the senate committee
wai opposed to granting this right to
San Francisco, and if a vote had been
forced at the last session the grant
would have been defeated. The reso
lution was not brought to a vote.
Strenuous efforts will be made by the
city to get this grant confirmed by the
next congress, but there is a sentiment
throughout the nation which is grow
ing more powerful every day to bring
about a revocation of the grant. It
may not be this year and it may not
be next, but the day Is bound to come
long before the valley can be mutilated
by the damming.
Esthetic vs. Utilitarian
"I take Issue with those who say
that the esthetic must give way to the
utilitsrian. The millions of dollars in
vested In city parks and public gal
leries and museums are a refutation of
this statement. It is not all of life to
eat and drink and sleep and be clothed.
The wage earners and wealth pro
ducers may not all be able to visit the
Yosemltti national park, but many of
them have already done so and more
will follow. Xn time, I predict that the
wage earners of this state will be doing
as the citizens of Germany now do,
who deprive themselves of luxuries
and save throughout the year that they
may spend a few.days of rest nnd re -
reatloln with their families in the
scenic regions of Europe.
"When that time shall have arrived
those wealth producing pilgrims to the
Yosemlte national park will revere the
name of John Muir and call him
bleaied becauM he had that prophetic
vision and patriotic unselfishness
Which i-auHiil him to labor and en
deavor to preserve from the ravages of
the present day commercialism and
save from unnecessary destruction

      <text>CITY THROWS OFF SPRING VALLEY YOKE SAN FRANCISCO LINKS HERSELF TO THE SIERRAS City Now
        Possesses Water Sources Adequate .to Needs of 2,000,000 Population Promise Made That Plant
        Will Be in Operation in Five . Years' Time antagonism from the public platform. The
        tabulated result of the vote shows that in every district the Spring Val ley received a
        majority, it failed of the necessary two-thirds in those sections where the labor influence
        Is heaviest. It is clear, however, that the labor vote was divided. A large element in the
        labor council was committed to the Spring Valley, as well as the Hetch Hetchy proposition,
        and the tally shows that this faction registered its convic tions. A scattering: opposition
        in some of the generally reputed conservative districts contributed to Spring Valley's
        defeat. »^ In Five Years* Time The future presents the prospect of a new competition — the
        city and the com pany. The water controversy has shifted so rapidly in the past that the
        situation five or ten years hence can not now be foreseen. Mayor McCarthy promised again
        last night that he would bring Hetch Hetchy water to the local consumers wltlftn five years.
        "We will begin work at both ends," said he, "and we will construct it ac cording to the best
        engineering meth ods." The strong sentiment that called for the purchase of Spring Valley
        may not remain content. The advocates of the dual project feel that they may be justified in
        again submitting the issue to the voters. Such a course was fol lowed with ultimate success
        with the Geary street railway. ;\u25a0 ; •'. Second Submission Possible There is nothing in
        the charter, as far as could be legally determined last night, that prevents a second submis
        sion to the people. Should the electorate at some future date decide to buy Spring Valley
        for $35,000,000, a unique situation will have been created. The charter contains no
        provision for the retirement of bonds once authorized. It -would require an amendment by
        which the excess of the Hetch Hetchy issue could be canceled. These, however, are all
        matters for the future. , For the present the Spring Valley option expires, the city has
        committed itself to the great Sierra etnterprise, and the administration has announced Its
        determination to proceed according to the mandate of the people. HETCH HETCHY PLANS AND
        ESTIMATED COST The Hetch Hetchy water supply sys tem as voted for yesterday provides for a
        delivery of 60.000,000 gallons daily. The plans and estimates for the expenditure of
        $45,000,000 call for" a power development fully equal to all pumping requirements. The work
        of construction in the various divisions, according to the report of City Engineer Manson,
        will cost as follows: Uifce Eleanor dirision $1.534,525 Tuolumne <Jir !itk>n 3.285,400 Foothill
        dMfclon 1.705.500 Valley <siTision ».115,700

Eeal estate "and rigbU of way 1,000,000
J40.539.225
Contingencies and engineering 4,160,775
Total $43,000,000
According to the estimates of Mars
den Manson the Hetch Hetchy system
can give a daily supply of 60,000,000
gallons, which will be almost twice as
large as that now being furnished by
Spring Valley. Apart from the water
supply the estimates look to a reduc
tion of $300,000 annually on the light
ing expenses of the city, the lighting to
be made an incident to the public own
ership and operation of the Lake Tu
olunine source. " /
Manson' s plan of construction calls
          for a" reservoir at Lake Eleanor and
at some later date at Hetch .Hetchy
valley with a minimum combined ca
pacity of 105,000.000 gallons. There
will be a diverting dam and canal 29
miles long, to Bear gulch, where a
power station will be erected capable
of developing 12.000 horsepower. From
Bear gulch station conduits will run
.to the Dry creek power station, 14
miles distant, where 4,500 horsepower
will be generated.
Big double 48 inch pipes will carry
the water over the San Joaquin val
ley. A pumping station and immense
reservoir will be built at Altamont and
the water brought into the city either
around the bay at Alviso or across at
Dumbarton. A telephone system to cost
$1,661,000 is included in the estimates.
The proposition is that the wVter
from the main supply be* received at
Belmont and In two reservoirs near the
intersection of Mission and Amazon
streets, having a combined capacity of
203.000,000 gallons. From there It
could be supplied both by gravity and
pumping stations through 38 miles of
main and force pipes to 21 servlee res
ervoirs in the five different levels Into
which the area to be supplied, is di
vided.

SPRING VALLEY BONDS
Xot a district south of Market street
gave the Spring Valley proposition the
required two-thirds vote, although scat
tering precincts did. With that part of
the city populated almost entirely by
union labor voters, it would appear that
Mayor P. H. McCarthy had sufficient
strength among the members of the
Union Labor party to encompass the
defeat of the Spring Valley proposition
by 1,234 votes.
Of the districts north of Market
street all gave' more than the two
thirds vote, except the thirty-sixth,"
          which extends / from Hayes valley
          across Market street to the south; the
          thirty-eighth, comprising part of the
          Western addition; the forty-fourth, of
          which the Barbary coast is a large.fac

          tricts, which lie Just south of Market
          street from Fourth out , to Eleventh,
          and 'the forty-fourth ' district, showed
          the greatest dislike for. Spring Valley,'

PROMISE TO RUSH WORK
Mayor P. H. McCarthy
The result of the election held to
day demonstrates the. people of
this city and county are in control of
the situation. The vote* for Hetch
Hetchy demonstrates to the satis
faction of the federal authorities
that the people of this city look to
that source for the future bigger
and better San Francisco \vs\ter sup
ply. .
The people have also demonstrated
by their votes that they do not want
Spring Valley at- anything like, the
figure that those In control of the
city's government, as well as those
In control of the. corporations, at the
time the ordinance was -drawn de
manded.'
Now that the decks are clear no
time .will be lost In bringing into
this 'city in the best possible form
and at the ,Jen«i possible 'expense
the waters of/ Lake. E leanor and the
Tuolumne river and its tributaries,
and then, as occasion shall demand,
the waters of Hetch ll etchy valley
through the construction of dams
for proper and sufficient storage.
I, of course, feel very much pleased
with the. action taken by the people
at todays-e lection, since it demon
strates beyond the shadow of a doubt
the fact that no matter how the
authorities, both of the city govern
ment and the Spring Valley water
company, might shuffle things, as
they did when they combined the
two propositions. in order to deceive
the voters, they could not shake the
confidence of the -people In the pres
SPRING VALLEY IS

The " tonly thing for San Fran
          claco to do now Is to go right
          ahead with the Hetch Hetchy
          supply* I'«t us get to work. The
people by an overwhelming -vote
have Indorsed the Viikr Klennor
*nd Tuolumne river source and
have authorized a $4.1,000,000
bond issue to bring the Sierra
supply to the doors of San Fran
cisco.
The Spring Valley purchase Is
beaten by 1.234 votes, ' and that
          ban now gone by. President
          Bourn and the directors made the
          single offer to the city and we
          do not know that they will care
          under any circumstances to re
          new It. ,
          Bourn may be delighted with
          the turn of events.- At any rate,
          we may count on the undying
          hostility of the company to every
          step the city may take. I do not
          see that there Is any way now
          for the city to acquire Spring
          Valley. We will have to fight
          every inch of ground to retain
          our hold In the Sierras, and years
          of litigation confront us, for the
          corporation will exhaust every
          resource to block and baffle . the

          district, in which the Mission Dolores
          Is situated, tried hard to roll up. the
          two-thirds required but failed, the vote
          being 1.510 to 838. The Western addi
          tion polled nearly 65 per cent in favor
          of Spring Valley, the vote in the thirty :
          eighth being 1.643 to 896. The thirty
          third district, which reaches out to
          Ocean View, voiced its opposition by

          The banner district for Spring Valley
          was the forty-first, in which falls Pa

          tieth, the northern part of the Western
          addition, had a vote of 73 per cent In
          favor of purchasing Spring Valley,
          while the thirty-ninth, which embraces
          the Richmond and Sunset districts, fol
          lowed with 72 per cent on its big vote
          of 3,483 to 1,361. The thirty-seventh

' With the city almost a unit in voting
$45,000,000 for the Hetch Hetchy propo
sition, there were still some interesting
facts in connection with the voting.
Eleven precincts gave solid, votes for
the proposition, not a vote being re
corded against it. These precincts were
the first and third of the twenty-ninth
district, the twenty-first of the thirty
second district, the eleventh of the
thfrty-fifth district, the eighth of the
thirty-sixth district, the fifteenth and
nineteenth of the fortieth district, the

polled. The twenty-first precinct of the
thirty-second district voted unanimous-,
ly for Hetch Hetchy, while Spring Val
ley got 33 against 40. There were a few
other precincts that gave less than half
their votes for Spring Valley. The deni
zens of the ' Barbary coast had ithoir

The vote was much lighter than, that
on the Geary street Railroad proposition
two weeks ago; even though muclv more
money was involved/ but this i was due
to the apathy of many voters who

          Sierra* I do not believe the fed
          eral government enn or will seek
          to overturn. The city han acted
          under the authority of the act of
          congrresn and by the work already
          accomplished \u25a0•- so perfected ils

WORK WILL BEGIN AT

" Hetch Hetchy system, now that the
          people of San Francisco have made the
          final decision, • at the earliest possible

          the plant I will urge, as president of
          the board of public works, that work
          be carried on at both ends at the same

          in the mountains the distributing plant
          can be under construction in the city.

        - , The bills were sent Chairman Mon dell from the White: House to be pre sented in
        connection with the message of the president, which was read in the house today. They
        included meas ures for the temporary withdrawal of lands, for the classification of lands,
        prescribing methods for the disposal of classified 'lands by leasing and for the disposal *o
        foil, gas and phosphate lands. Mondell's idea of legislation that is needed along these
        'lines differed so radically from that entertained by the president that he told his friends
        that he would not be justified in presenting the bills* in a manner designed to give them
        his "indorsement. > The president is said to have decided to seek another member of the com
        mittee on "public lands to stand sponsor for the proposed legislation. •\u25a0 "Request

        Whether or not Mrs. Elnora Swltz was ever mar ried to the'late Arthur< Switz , the son
          of a wealthy furniture dealer of Kear
          ney, Neb., was the point of argument
          in a suit before Judge Lcnnon today.
          Mrs. Switz, a handsome and fashion
          ably dressed widow of the brunette
          type, is suing to terminate the home
          stead of Mill Valley property, valued
          at $25,000. Frederick J. Switz. her
          father in law, opposes her plan. He
          asserts that she was never married to
          his son.
          According to her statement. Mx 3.
          Switz was married to Arthur- Switz at
          Ventura, Cal., November 27, 1897. Switz

          was homesteaded.

          William D. Wasson's complaint in his
suit against District' Attorney Charles

          slander was " pronounced defective by
Judge tHunt yesterday, a demurrer in
terposed by Fickert's attorneys, Bren
nan Lane, being sustained.
. Wasson complained that Fickert in
public speeches during, the , election
campaign stated that the plaintiff had
offered him the support of the Daily
News if he would appoint Heney to
take charge of the graft cases.
" Wasson's failure' to allege that Flck
          eft was a candidate for district at
          torney at the time he made these
          statements made the complaint mean

          skillfully, in the right proportions, with

        Make Indians Wild
        Again, Says Pastor
        Philadelphia, Jan. 21.—Modern
        jazz music and dancing are making
        the Indians wild again. The roll of
        the snare drum and the wail of the
        saxophone, combined with the "tod
        dle" and the "shimmy" stir atavistic
        memories of the tom-tom and the
        shriek of the victim at the stake.
        So asserted Dr. Henry Beets of

        missions of the Christian Reformed
        church, in an address Friday before
        the session of the Friends of the
        Indian.
        A resolution he introduced seek
        ing to forbid Indian youths and girls
        from dancing the modern steps, was

      <text>The Origin of Jazz
        (BY MADGE R. CAYTON)
        Just what is jazz? One has a vague idea of a dis
        orderly number of sounds played entirely for dancing.
        But jazz has a far deep.r significance. It is an attempt
        to reproduce the marvelous syncopation of the African
        Jungle. It is the result of the savage musican's won
        derful gift of progressive retarding and acceleration
        which is guided by his sense of ewing. He who would
        play ja^z nnut have rhythmic aggressiveness. As one
        iran put it, ja: z music is the rtelirum tr mens of suyco
        pL.i'on. It n strict rhythm without melody.
        The words ja;, jazz, jazz, J3Z, and jascz are of
        Afrcan origin but come direct form the Creole patois
        and idiom meaning "speed things up." For in th> old
        plantation days when the slaves were having one of their
        rare holidays an fun would languish, some West Coast
        African would say, "jazz hdT up," and then things would
        go fast and furious. Today "jazz her up," is still a
        slang expression with the same meaning.
        There are two types of jazz: One originating in
        China, which is called Siames 3 music, and the other
        originating in Africa having only a general name ofjazz applied to it. Since the Siamese
        music or Oriental
        jazz, as it is often called, stay:d strictly in China and
        underwent no futher development it is not important.
        But the jazz that originated in Africa, or the Occidental
        jazz is known the world ov-r and because of its impor
        tance w> will trace its growth only.
        Occidental jazz first came to life on the West Coast
        of Africa. There big sturdy warriers danced to tli? music
        of throbbing Tom —Toms while the entire jungle was
        the accompanying orchestra.
        Then it spread, reaching Cuba thru deported slaves.
        It found a rich soil there for its growth, since the
        jungles of Africa were not so different from the swamps
        of Cuba. All of that "Hula Hula stuff," goes straight
        back to Africa for its origin. Then jazz was transplanted
        into America, entering from the south and creeping
        up until it covered all of America. About that time the
        war broke out and when our boys went to Europe and
        and especially to France they took their beloved jazz
        with them. So Paris was initiated into a new world of
        music over which they promptly went wild.
        But jazz has found her strongest support in the
        United States. When jazz arived in America via New
        Crleans it almost died leaving only a little spark fostered
        by the slaves and New Orleans underworld. For years
        jazz has ruled the New Orleans underworld resorts,
        thei>- natrons dancing to jazz for gladsome generations
        Ragtime and the new dances came from there. Then
        slowly, little by little, jazz crept up the Missippi from
        resort to resort until it landed in Chicago at Freiburg's
        whither it had been proceded by stanzas of "Must I
        Hesitate"? "The Blues", 'Frankie and Johnnie," and
        other classics of the levee underworld that seems to
        please the savage part of us. From there it spread
        like wild fire all over the United States, hitting the
        Middle West the hardest and the extreme East the
        lightest. Jazz has reigned supreme for some years and
        CAYTON'S MONTH! V
        most likely, will reign for many more for it has invaded
        our dance halls, theaters, and concert halls. Even our
        churchs have not escaped without their share of tem
        petious music. It has even snatched our very song»,
        classical and popular, and taken them for its own use
        ragging them to death.
        One use to think of a band as a group of respectable
        looking beings usally with a splendid musical ability.
        But when one gazes upon a jazz band he sees a bunch of
        s .emingly demented men, contorting themselves and
        their instruments far better than a St Vitis dancer.
        For the modern jazz band is in reality a young army
        artillery. The howitzers of the band ara stationed in
        the trap drum, snare drum, cymbals, triangle, wooden
        blocks, xylophone, cow bells, rattles and whistles for
        the production of various weried noises. The trome
        bones represent the field guns, the clarinets, oboes,
        saxophones, auto homes and cornets furnish thol rapid
        lire batteries. The range being point blank one can
        easily s^e why the effect of the drum fire is so complete.
        Some say that jazz is sensual. If so why has it
        lived in America so long? For this reason: Jazz is of
        tho ravage and therefore clemntal in its appeal. It is
        bouterous, rough, but the very soul of kindly good
        humor and care free merriment. It is the music siren
        of the dance for while one is swept thru a neck breaking,
        whirl-wind measura his own cares and responsibilities
        are brushed aside. In America especially because we,
        ;00, are of a strenous nature, we nejd and must find
        some sort of energetic exercise as a conteractant. The
        old fashioned, dreamy waltez and graceful, measured
        minuets are things of the past. The tired business man,
        the worn out mother, the discouraged poet, as well as
        the impatient youths, seek and find relief in jazz. Then
        ddi not th dough boys find a wonderful solace in their
        beloved jazz? For while under its throes they forgot
        the bloody battle field, the stench of decaying bodies;
        they even forgot there was such a thing as war. Then
        jazz is d mocratic. It is simple enough for any one to
        understand and enough of a vampire to coax every one
        into a world of oblivion. Can we not then say that jazz
        has existed for a purpose and has truly fulfilled that
        purpos;.?
        But on the other hand one must be careful that the
        alluring god of jazz, Mumbo Jumbo, does not lead us so
        far from the true god of music, Pan, that we fail to
        appr ciate the real classic. Might not one thus uncon
        sciouly sell his birth-right for a mess of pottage?
        Because jazz is elemental bringing the savage to the
        curface, it is dang rous. We cannot afford in our
        present stage of civilization to accept the standard of
        the savage even if it is only thru the giddy measure of
        a dance. True jazz belongs to the "forest primeval"
        and is mor: real and refined there than in a hall filled
        with dancer.3. The very fact that the growth of jazz
        las been thru the under world resorts of America is a
        E rong po'nt in i's disfavor. In embrasing what we
        now c..11 a necessary evil is there not a chance of jazz
        becoming the key to open our souls to the passions our
        fore fathers nave spent generations in trying to over

      <text>Urge better music as the first step in Dance Reform Jazz Responsible for Most of the
        Evils, Say Teachers By Wilbur Forrest JAZZ," that root of much evil in music, a menace to
        established rythmical law and order and beauty and grace, is dying its slow but natural
        death Syncopation which tends ^toward "shimmying," wriggling and hop? ping about dance
        floors as in the days cf prehistoric barbarism is dis? appearing and, according to those
        authorities who make it their busi? ness to study dancing, the demise of "jazz" occasions
        more general joy than sorrow. Puritanical grand? mothers and perhaps less prudish fathers
        and mothers who attend and chaperon social dances of the young need not much longer blush
        when their eyes sweep the ballroom. The youth of the nation may, after all,grow up amidst
        less sensuous music and dancing positions which em? barrass their elders. A reaction against
        this sort of thing is in full swing in the United States and, like a burned out plague,
        "jazz" music and "jazz" dancing are leaving us. While "jazz"' still retains its ad? mirers
        and supporters, its own ridiculousness has done more toward it? eliminatii n than any other
        agen? cy, believes Fenton T. Bott, presi? dent of the American National As? sociation,
        Masters of Dancing, who is now in New York to attend the thirty- annual convention of that
        association, beginning August 25, at the Hotel Astor. For Clean Dancing The association,
        with it? more than five hundred active members in every city cf any r-ize in the UYiited
        States and Canada, has been one of the agencies working quietly sincethe advent of "jazz" to
        keep danc? ing clean and moral. In coopera? tion with many civic and welfare so? cieties
        throughout the country, much has been done to eliminate the sala ciou: and immoral features
        which this form of syncopation brought he dance floor. "We do not recognize the terrr
        'jazz,' which is purely a coined word," Mr. Bot; told The Tribune "We ever, recognize synco
        d.we have nothing agai?.si of syncopated music. It can be playi i so brilliantly if played
        right, and then again it can ther form so sensu? ous and evil that it harks clear back to
        the wild and irresponsible barba? rism of the dark ages. We have tried and preach modera?
        tion. Civilization has begun to re? volt against the wrong kind of syn? copation, tins
        so-called 'jazz,' whicrduring tne more unrestrained perioc of the war swept the country witl
        a crop of immodesty in both son? and dance in its wake. It first ap peared on the stage, and
        eventually it audaciously entered the publi; dance hail and private ballroon alike. "There
        is a decided upward tren? in music now, as compared with i year ago," continued the dance
        mas ter president. "New York, a leade in entertainment whose example i followed everywhere,
        is setting cleaner pace. Compare New York' roof gardens of some of the leadin? hotels,
        compare the theaters, th moving picture palaces and even th dance halls now with a year age
        Twelve months ago the 'jazz' crnz was everywhere. It was reflecte^ from the stage, the dance
        floor anc in a wave of ribald, suggestive song Written and distributed to every cot ner of
        the land. It invaded thhome in the form of magazine il lustrations, on lithographed cover of
        sheet music, in graphophone an pianola records. Displaced hy Good Musie "To-day we find
        'jazz' dying natural death. This form of syncc Pation is giving way in motion pi<
tore houses to pipe organs and grea
          orchestras playing real and beaut
          f'Jl music, it is to be heard less i

oncers inspired by slow, barbaror
?Ksic Public dance halls are fa
?leaner, if we are to believe the at
%rities. And all of this is n(
toly true of New York but of th
country at large."
The president of the America
National Association, Masters
Dancing, ?3 a citizen of DaytoiOhio, where he conducts a dancin
Waden-y attended by juvenile men
oers of some of Dayton' a first fam
          including "Young Jimmy" Co:
          a?ed fourteen, son of the Democrat
nominee for President.
"It is such folks as these that ov

There has been virtually no op?
position to the anti-jazz campaign
waged by his organization except
from a few unscrupulous dance hall
proprietors, said the president.
"Dancing is an essential," he
added. "What would tens of thou?
sands of people do nightly in New
York if they were not permitted togo somewhere, meet socially, and
dance? If the places where these
people meet are decent there can be
no finer, more healthful or enjoy?
able recreation anywhere."
"What do you consider good or
bad positions in dancing?" he was
asked.
"It is difficult to illustrate posi?
tions," he answered. "Anyone can
see with a glance over the dance
floor wdiether positions are good or
bad. When you take hold of a girl
to dance, common sense and decency
should prompt your position. If your
attitude toward her is proper, you
will not crush your body against
hers nor place your cheek against
hers.
A Form of Exercise
"Clean dancing is an efficient
form of exercise, amusement and
recreation for both sexes. It devel?
ops muscle coordination which re?
sults in grace of movement. Girls
run, roll hoops and skip the rope
during their more youthful yearsbut later their play becomes more
sedentary, and should be supple?
mented by class exercises and
games. Dancing is one of these.
Dancing is likewise a mind quicken
er. By fixing the attention, bringing
to bear the force of will on the com?
plicated actions of the body, it edu?
cates the mental faculties. This is
especially true of aesthetic dancing,
during the performance of which
the muscles of the arms and trunk
are used, as well as those of the
legs.
"Sometimes the dancing school is
misunderstood," continued the mas?
ter. "The dishonest and unscrupu?
lous dance hall proprietor may give
the clean dancing academy a bad
name, just as some classes of thea?
ters may give the theater a bad
name. The theater is a great insti?
tution, but it is all wrong from the
wrong standpoint. The same is true
of dancing and dancing schools. Thewrong angle may be applied to them
just as to the theater.
To Ask Church's Aid
The American National Associa?
tion during its coming convention in
New York will renew a long-studied
effort to gain the cooperation of the
Methodist Church in the promotion
of clean dancing. This denomina?
tion takes a stand in its "blue laws"
against dancing in any form, and
during the last General Conference,
some years ago, a resolution to
amend the "blue laws" was voted
down. A group of "progressive"
Methodists, led by J. Henry Smythe,
of New York, is to-day avowedly in
favor of dancing, and will carry the
fight into the next Methodist General
Conference. The "conservatives"
are said to be adamant in their re?
fusal to lift a ban prescribed almost
half a century ago on many forms of
amusement.
"Dancing is older than Christi?
anity," said the president of the
dancing masters. "It will live so
long as there is music. It is our
struggle to keep this form of amuse?
ment clean and moral, and we feel
that the Methodist Church can do
more for humanity by helping us
than by opposing dancing in general.
It is only the older and more con?
servative Methodists who now op?
pose dancing. Younger Methodists
favor it."
Allied with the dancing masters'
organization against what is termed
improper music and dancing, many
social and civic societies have
been doing their part. A pamphlet
issued by the organization, contain?
ing "Rules, Regulations and Sugges?
tions Governing S^pcial Dancing,"
j has been distributed by the thousand
^y social welfare societies and the
H-elfare department of the United
States government. Universities
and colleges, demanding authorita?
tive knowledge on proper and im?
proper dancing during school func?
tions, have beer, supplied with these
rules and regulations almost every
where in the United States.
The Actors' Eejuity Association,
?m organization composed of thou?
sands of actors and actresses, is an
able element allied against forms of
music and dancing which might tend
toward a bad effect on the general
public.
The dancing masters have success?
fully solicited the cooperation of
"^ong publishers, who have in turr?
i toned down suggestive titles and
Mthographs on sheet music. Phonr?
graph companies, spending tens o?
thousands of dollars monthly in
j brightly colored magazines, have
been prevailed upon to make their
advertising less "jazzy."
The General Federation of Worn
j en's Clubs, one of the most active
agencies in the United States, is
working for music reform. At the
biennial conference in June at D.es
Moines a resolution was passed con?
demning popular songs which smack
of vulgarity and initiating an open
campaign for better American music.
Mrs. Marx E. Oberndorf er (Anne
Shaw Faulkner), cf Chicago, wife
of the famous pianist, selected na
tional music chairman, is to-day
planning and directing the music
activities of more than 19,000 wom?
an's clubs. By means of music mem
ory contests in schools, churches, de?
partment stores, industries and in?
stitutions and the establishment of
i community music centers, she plans
to save a nation threatened by
"jazz" and "ragtime."

ing her through the different sleps.
Thoughtlessness on the part of both
lady and gentleman in taking out?
landish positions is responsible for
most of the criticism directed
:.gainst modern social dancing.
"All exaggerated movements, espe?
cially of the upper part of the body,
are in very bad taste in social danc?
ing and are never found with true
refinement and culture. Couples
dancing with their faces together
show such extreme* bad taste that
it should be unnecessary even to call
attention to it."
"All in all," says President Fenton
Botts, "the campaign has done much
to cleanse modern dancing, but
'jazz,' the root if it all, has done
more to eliminate itself than all the
campaigns.
"The American 'jazz' craze has
been like a popular celebration?for
a day or two all is enthusiasm, flags
and speeches. Soon it wanes and
dies its natural death."
Jazz, he believes, is now dying
that natural e'.eath, and European
nations which so quickly adopted the
American craze will see its Ameri?
can demise spread across the seas.
Jazz has had its day.</text>

        In this sense I agree with any theo
        logian as'• to the consequences of
        degrading practices. There is no use
        to quibble over details In so far
        as jazz dancing relaxes morality and
        undefatiines the institution of the fami
        ly it is an- element of tremendous evil.
        Besides the testimony of the scitfn
        tist I woul 1 place the words of Prof.
        J. Louis Guyon who characterizes
        the "shimmey" as a "pelvic massage"
        and who'' declares' that many couples
        should' have marriage licences before
        stepping upon the dance floor. Prof.
        Guyon, by the way is the proprietor
        of the largest dance hall on the west
        side Of Chicago. It is significent that
        he has barred jazz dancing and even
        the "fox trot" He says:
        "Ndw modern dancing is creating
        an army of degenerates: It is break

        the publicdoes not become nauseated
        with its ow.n ball-room conduct and

        ft is taking the whole matter with as
        tounding seriousness. Press, pulpit and
        powerful public leaders all are thun
        j dering against the dance importations
        from America. And they are accusing
        them of being responsible for more aw
        ful things than you can shake we al
        most said shake a shimmy a stick at
        Those making the charges against our
        jazz steps run all the way from national
        figures, writers, doctors and philosophers
        to a famous nude dancer, who has come
        right out and declared that the prances,
        j wiggles and slides from the U. S. A. are
        the limit and then some.
        France certainly is much upset. She
        Is up in arms as she has not been on any
        non-political question for some time. The
        French dancing masters are bewailing
        the damage to their art. French musi
        cians are protesting the assaults on their
        music. French parents are worried about
        (their children.
        And we? Well, over here in America
        we can hardly understand it. We were
        not surprised when jazz dancing was the
        target for a good deal of fire within
        our own lines. That was to be expect
        ed. But what is to happen when Paris
        accuses us of the rough stuff? Wasn't
        it from Paris that those Apache dances
        came? Those knock-down and drag-out
        steps from the Parisian underworld, with
        their wild abandon and unleashed pas
        sion? Beside that, we had thought that
        any of the little measures we tread
        seemed like mere minuets.
        But the French, it appears, think dif
        ferently on that subject.
        The "Revue Mondiale," influential
        Paris paper, has got together a mass
        of opinions on American dance steps
        which is not at all flattering. In fact,
        some of them might be called damning
        and others of them shouldn't really be
        printed.
        Regina Badct, who appears on the
        stage and dances in a string or so of
        beads and a few bracelets, goes on rec
        ord as saying that the American stylo
        of dancing is to be condemned for its
        sensuousness.
        Modern dancing is low and ugly, Abel
        Hermant says. Victor Marguerite terms
        it "a precocious and dangerous de
        floration." B. Baudrillart. of the Acad
        emy, admits that reaction from the
        war is some excuse, but is much worried
        at the effect of the craze for dancing at
        all hours. One correspondent branded
        dancing as "a hypocritical form of ob
        taining Illicit pleasure Medical ver-
        Their Blare As "Ugly, Ridiculous and Mra' 1
        Indecent," but the Public Refuses M I
        To Be Shocked
        an jazz has so captivated all France th
        diets handed down by mental specialists,
        surgeons, nerve specialists and others
        condemn the dancing of to-day as very
        bad for the moral welfare, as well as
        for the future of the race.
        "And it comes from America," they
        end up by saying, accusingly.
        "Look at that new dance, the 'Balan
        cello,' that came from Genoa around the
        time of the conference, and was about
        the only thing that happened then," the
        French cry. "It's a one-step and a
        shiver combined. Terrible! Even though
        the Americans wouldn't come to Genoa,
        we are willing to wager they sent that
        dance."
        There's no telling where the craze will
        end, if you believe the French papers
        At the head of this page is
        reproduced a famous French
        artist's very sarcastic com- .gg
        ment on the absurd lengths to 0
        which he thinks the Amcri-
        cans have carried their acro
        batic dances. He pictures six dances
        which, if not already in vogue, he be
        lieves soon will be.
        No. 1 is what he calls the Jugglers'
        Jazz. It is a trifle wearing on the back
        of the neck, but it does leave the feet
        so free.
        Then there is the Upside-Down Camel
        Walk, in which the couple is shown in
        the act of reversing.
        No. 8 is the Back-to-Back Fox Trot.
        Even more criticism than was aroused
        by the cheek-to-cheek dancing may bo
        occasioned by this back-to-back stuff.
        Next comes the Marine Glide, a step
        which it will not be wise to indulge in
        for at least one hour after eating.
        No. 5 is the Tipsy-TojiBy Toddle, a
        combination of the shimmy, the Chicago
        and the giant swing.
        The last is a novelty which the artist
        christens the Lunch Counter Whirl.
        But the French are not all taking the
        American manner of tripping it on the
        light fantastic toe in such a light fan
        tastic mood. Some are treating it in
        what they consider a spirit of stark,
        grim realism. There's Paul Bourget, of
        the French Academy, for instance, who
        has announced that his next novel is to
        deal with the adventures of a young girl,
        who, smitten by the microbe of the
        dance, is dragged down and down as if
        by drink.- "Dope" and the gigolos, or.
        professional dancing men, then compass
        her ruin.
        Abel Hemant hesitates to subject
        the characters in his novels to the
        tango, maxixc and fox trot. "These so-

        ing that dances are
        based on love, "and
        dancers should choose B
        the noblest, instead of jastf
        the most impure. Every

        fact that the gestures do not mm
        approach too closely to the JPp '5
        reality of the thing symbol- 1
        ized."
        A number of French scien
        tists and savants whose words carry
        weight all have uttered words of cau
        tion against the harm to the moral wel
        fare of the nation which may result
        from the physical excitement engendered
        by the styles of modern dancing. Mme.
        Augustin Lofert, whose husband direct
        ed the French Academy of the Dance,
        deplores cheek-to-cheek dancing, hug
        ging and wrestling holds. Maurice Level
        sees peril in the habit of women in leav
        ing off their cornets for a dance.

        Premier Poincare, who is said to
        haye been prompted to the under
        taking by the municipal council.
        Among those complaining have been the
        French musicians who have been losing
        employment because of the prevalence
        of the darkey jazz bands. The banjo
        and the saxophone have superseded the
        violin and the flute, Only negroes are
        considered to be the proper performers
        on jazz instruments, and restaurants and
        dance halls will employ only them. It
        is called the "Black Peril."
        Yet in spite of this general condem
        nation of the American jazz dances,
        thoir hold on the French public grows
        stronger and stronger.
        Dance places are springing up like
        mushrooms and their number never
        seems to decrease. Maurice and Hughes
        have opened a new palace on the Rue
        Cammartin. The "So Different" and the
        floors at the Carlton, the Claridgc, the
        Scheherazade, Mirabeau and Ba1 Bul
        lier all are crowded.
        It has come to be pretty well under

        A new dancing place is said to open

        takes so little space.
        There are attempt? to introduce
        l ew steps, but all of them are vain
        unless they bring new innovations in
        American jazz. And those seem to be

        Some say the younger generation is

        just exactly what one might expect

        The manner in which the dancing
        instructors put the blame on the
        chaps who create tunes is exemplified
        by R. W. Vizay, president of the Am
        erican Society of Dancing Teachers.
        "Dancing is wholly a matter of
        music," he said. "The reason a
        waltz is out of date is because there
        is no' Strauss today to compose a real
        one and make the people glide to it
        When good music is composed, good
        dancing will result. As long as you
        have jazz mtTSfc you will have jazz

        A very small proportion of couples
        dance properly these days, Mr. Viz
        ay remarked. Take the ordinary
        ballroom, he said, and you will see 20
        couples toddling, five shimmying,
        three doing the "Chicago" and ten

      <text>No Art Exempt in Moral Law, Says Dr. Van Dyke Ridicule Will Kill Immodest Dress and In
        decent Dances, Asserts Princeton Professor, Unstirred by Alarmist Reports on Present Day
        Standards N unusual and most interesting point of view in the current com ment on present
        day morals is afforded by the accompanying in terview with Dr. Henry Van Dyke. Readers of
        the Magazine Section of THE NEW YORK HERALD have been treated recently to the trenchant
        utterances of Bishop Gailor of the Protestant Episcopal Church, Bishop Burgess of Long
        Island and many other noted members of the clergy. Last Sunday was presented an outline of
        the campaign begun by Episcopal church women to better conditions. Dr. Van Dyke's long
        pastorate of the Brick Presbyterian Church in this city, his service as Minister to the
        Netherlands and his connection with Princeton Uni versity give him the widest possible
        viewpoint, and his words are espe cially impressive on that account. IN a preface to the
        definitive edition of his works now issuing from the press Dr. Henry Van Dyko refers to
        himself as an "adventurous conservative." words that fairly represent his attitude toward
        tho present moral condition of society, which Is ?being generally and severely criticised.
        Con servative, because he desires to remind peo ple of the great principles at the roots of
        art and morals that preserve the life of our best traditions, he yet adventures in quest of
        new things that may make life fuller, cleaner and better worth living:. "Whatever I have
        done, in whatever lit erary form I have done it, has been under taken in the hope that I
        might in some way help the 'other fellow.' The society in which we live affords but an
        approximation of Jus tice, and its gifts are unevenly distributed. Some men get more than
        they deserve and some less than they deserve. I must place myself in the former class; but
        if justifica tion is needed perhaps it may be found in the feeling always present in my mind
        that causes me to constantly seek, to 'adven ture.' for a better ordering of things. "I
        don't mean by this that I am a Com munist." continued Dr. Van Dyke, "for trials of communism
        in Rome, in France and in Russia have proved dismal failures, entail ing unnecessary misery,
        but there is a change coming, and we do not yet perceive In what form it will come, that
        will make the world a happier place. I had hoped, and still hope, that the first dawn of
        this change would lighten the world by a con cert of nations. The rays we think we see have
        not yet proved to be a false flawn. T welcome the change of administration at Washington,
        while holding to the belief that Woodrow Wilson will in time come to be considered as one of
        our greatest men. tie cause by this change, this new 'adventure.' it Is possible our hopes
        for a true dawn wilt focus. Alarmist Reports on Morals Fail to Stir Him Deeply "But when you
        ask me to give an opinion about the morals and manners of tho young genetjptlon I can't do
        it. Reports of how these manifest themselves irf our great cities do reach us here In
        Trlnceton. but deadened almost by distance. Surely the conditions which give rise to these
        reports are eccentricities common to every genera tion. I do not think they go very deep.
        Anyway, they sre but rumors here." In this delightful workshop a study fat enough removed
        from the main part of a solid, fine old Revolutionary house, it should be difficult to lend
        one's mind to the silly things that are going on In noisier places; and. provided one Is
        able to accept the com forting thought that silly errors of dreras and deportment do not
        seriously affect the moral fibre of a people, they may be brushed aside as Dr. Van Dyke did.
        Avalon, the estate he bought in 1900. was in Revolutionary times the property of the
        Kitz-Randolph family and later owned by Commodore Balnbridge; It was the home of Judge
        Bayard, first American Commissioner of Claims in Great Britain after the Revo lution.
        Besides the interest attached t*> Its first residents there is another Incident that gives
        the place historic piquancy, for from a corner abutting on the road the last shot was fired
        In the Battle of Princeton. An 'embattled' farmer, whose name hag been lost, dragged a
        cannon there and fired a parting shot, as the last of the British host was disappearing In
        the retreat. Tn this peaceful home, ideal for literary labors. Dr. Van Dyke readily may be
        ex cused If he Interests himself rather more In the major aspects *of human progress than 1n
        their minor difficulties. Moreover, it Is his view that the right way to Improve the world
        Is by going back to the deep, first principles of human nature by bringing out the innate
        respect for what Is true and beautiful and good anjJ, reflecting this re spect in book,
        song, music and sculpture. Trying to Claim Rightful Place For Art and the Joy of Art hat he
        said before the Teachers' Con ference In Atlantic City on Sunday morn ing February 27 on the
        subject of art and morals had a sufficient Immediate message to be seir.ed upon by the dally
        press and In some instances meaning was attach*! to some of his remarks which they were not
        intended to carry. But said Dr. Van Dyke: .Newspaper reports were on the whole i >'ty fair,
        although, of course, they dwelt chiefly upon the negative points of attack and consequently
        Inst sight of the main ob ject of the address, which was positive and constructive. I was
        trying to claim a right ful place for art and the Joy of art and the pleasure that It gives
        In Ihe normal life of man." Dr. Van Dyke seemed to be surprised that his discourse on a
        subject so purely Intellectual should have been linked up in the public mind with a
        discussion of exist, ing moral conditions. He bad received, h" said, many requests from
        editors to write nut for publication what he had said. but. he declined them all. Now to
        Tut? New York Ifhaui.n ho was willing to repeat In exN nso what he had said. "Art. has It
        own laws and rules and prin ciples of beauty of which commerce, agri culture, politics and
        the other distinct de partments of man's life know nothing. In this sense It may be said
        that art is for art's sake, hut It cannot fulfil Its mission unless It Is also for 'man's
        sake,' and this necessarily brings it within the great circle of morals, which embraces all
        of the human life nnd every one of those distinct spheres of which I hsve Just spoken. "To
        claim that art Is exempt from moral law Is to degrade It below the level of humanity.
        "No#one could think m iking uch a claim for commerce, agriculture or politics. although the
        latter [here Dr. Van Dyke smiled whimsically] is someumos treated a.s if the moral law did
        not apply to it. "Fine art or poor art is to be judged by artistic laws. 'How Doth the
        Little Busy I to' and 'Let Dogs Delight to Bark and Bite' are not poetry, nor are Rogers's
        clay statuettes sculpture, although nobody can find any fault with them from the moral point
        of view. "On the other hand, by the judgment of mankind Dante's Divine Comedy, and the
        pictures of Rembrandt and Raphael, the sculptures of Michael Angelo are great art because
        they fulfil the laws which govern artistic production. "But when you have estimated a work
        of art according to that standard there still remains another question to art: What is its
        moral quality? It may have very little, practically, you may say, hardly any at all. like a
        picture of 'still life': flowers, fruit, furniture, but the moment it begins to touch human
        life and its problems then it almost invariably begins to have a distinct moral quality,
        good or evil. Jt has a relation t<
virtue or to vice; it purifies or it stains tin
          imagination.
"It uplifts or debases the mind: it can
lend a new charm to what is pure and noble
and it can expose, especially in the drama
and in fiction it can expose to scorn what
is mean and base and vile.
" Thus the evils of immodest dress and
          indecent dancing may be left to ridicule, the
          higher kind, which is satire, and the lower
          sort, which is caricature. These will kill, If
          they seek to do it, the eccentricities so miK i;
          in criticism. I understand that Miss Rachel
          Crothers's new play, ' Nice People,' has this
for a theme; she is a sound writer for th*
theatre and her new piece will help.
"Art, on the other hand, in any of its
manifestations, may he perverted by a false
intention, or by an unconscious yielding to
ihe lower impulses, so that it actually makes
goodness appear hateful or ridiculous and
badness appear heroic and attractive.
"It may play upon the strings of sensual
passions and tickle the nerves of prurient
curiosity and sexual hysteria, weakening
the fibre of diameter and confusing those
Dr. Henry Van Dyke describes himself as an adventurous con
servative. He is optimistic on the world' s moral status, despite silly
          errors of the young generation and alarmist reports.

?serious judgments o? life which every human
being is bound, at !east sometimes, to make.
" Please do not misunderstand mf. f tnink
          that taken as a whol<> the service of art to mankind has been high and
        nobte. The masterpieces, almost without exception, have in them an inspiration which is
        essen tially moral; that is to say, it springs from a recognition, a consciousness of an
        innate and everlasting' difference between that which is fine and fair and that which is
        foul and lewd. "I believe there are more good booki than evil books, more good plays than
        evil plays, more good statues and pictures than evil ones, more fine music than evil music.
        But it still remains true that in each year in our great cities you may see, as 1 said to
        the teachers in their convention, 'some plays from which you might infer that the Sev enth
        Commandment is the only command ment. and the chief pleasure of life consists in breaking
        it.' "John Keats, whose centenary has just Calls Jazz an Invention of Imps for the Torment
        of Imbeciles, but Believes Good Music, Like Good Books, Will Always Exert Dominating
        Influence been celebrated throughout the English speaking world, has a very fine remark on
        the moral side of poetry. You will find it in his ode entitled 'Bards of Passion and of
        Mirth': Here your earth born souls still speak To mortals of their little week. Of their
        sorrows and delights, (if their passions and their spites, Of their glory and th*ir shame
        What doth strengthen and what maim. "Now, Keats is distinctly a poet's poet; he represents
        the a?sthetic spirit in all its beauty. Here is a line in which he reveals the application
        of the moral law to art: 'What doth strengthen and what maim.' That's the question to ask
        about a work of art?does it make your spirit stronger or weaker, does it build you up and
        inspire you and move you with sane and healthy feel ings or does it cripple you and lower
        your moral tone and fill you with morbid thoughts and hysterical impulses? "Take the art of
        music. Great music, even merely good music which .has melody and harmony in it, flows around
        us like a stream of pure, clear water or, like the bil lows of the great sea, it refreshes
        and it strengthens, but sensual music, lascivious music, mean music?if it can be called
        music at all?irritates, demoralizes and vulgarizes those who listen to it. Jazz Invented by
        Imps for The Torment of Imbeciles "Jazz, for example, I think, was invented by imps for the
        torment of imbeciles. True, it does not contain any distinct immoral teaching, because music
        is not a didactic art, but jazz does contain a real immoral influence, because it confuses,
        bewilders, be numbs and befuddles the mind through the ears. It Is, in effect, the dope or
        knockout drop In the art of sound, "Laws against immoral art? Yes. I sup pose every
        civilized community has found It necessary to have something of that kind, otherwise we
        should have cartloads of filth dumped at our back doors every morning; but these laws, it
        should be remembered, are very imperfect in their scope and uncertain in their application.
        They can do a little to help I's, but not very much. To rely upon legislation as a safeguard
        against immorality in art?that is, as a real safe guard?Is a great mistake. The true de
        fence must be found in the discrimination, the taste, the conscience of the individual and
        the public. "We must learn to ask ourselves and we must teach our children to ask in art as
        well as in commerce and other human activities what is good tn Its effect and what is evil.
        "It is not healthy to drink poison, even from a jewelled cup. The shirt of Xessus may have
        been beautifully woven, but it was not a good garment to wear. After all, in thinking about
        art, that is to say, art of the higher kind, I como back to tho words of an okl book:
        'Whatsoever things are pure and lovely and of prood report, if there be any virtue and if
        there be any praise, think on these things.' "A man is made by his thoughts. What he loves
        he is apt to look at, what he looks at long he grows to be like. These are my views on art.
        and morals. They are what so many persons havPUfecn asking for since the address, really a
        sermon, delivered on a Sun day morning at Atlantic City, that now I am glad to have had tho
        opportunity to give tliem out in full." Belongs to No Reform Society but The Church and the
        United States "Are you a member of a reform society. Dr. Van Dyke?" "No," was his answer, "I
        do not belong to any reform society, except the church and the United States of America."
        Ten volumes of the sixteen promised by his publishers as the definitive edition of Dr. Van
        Dyke's writings have already ap peared in a beautiful dress of blue and gold. Of the stories
        "The Other Wise Man'' and "Fisherman's Luck" hold the apple of popu larity. These continue
        to sell like new books. A new book, a collection of essays, is to appear this spring, with
        the title "Camp Fires and Guide Posts." Certain of the author's war writings are included in
        tho volume. He does not intend to write specif ically about war experiences, but, said he:
        "Any real writing done now will have to bo tinctured by the war, that is inevitable. Mine
        cannot be an exception. But in justi fication of my continuing to write, if there needs one,
        I want to say that I nover put out a book or a smaller piece of work un less I feel a real
        impulse and also feel that my purpose is good. Whenever I am lit doubt on these points I try
        to recall the bock. I have a vision of something better coming to the world and wish to do
        what I can to make its coming sure and early, and whether my effort is in the shape of n
        poem, an essay or a story, the purpose nover changes. "My creed is simple: Keep what is
        good, discard what is bad and look confidently for a change to tho better. I love the life
        here at Princeton and am happy in it, but as soon as I feel I'm getting stale in my
        university work I want to be off. Just now it begins to look that this coming summer or next
        fall I shall get away on a lonn journey to the Far East, but nothing is settled yet. "And
        now we will write 'finis' to my views on all the subjects you have asked me about. If they
        turn out to be too long or too dull use the blue pencil, cut 'cm remorselessly. You have my

        Th danolng that ha been Indulged
        In at some of the public dancing hall
        In Chattanooga haa been the subject
        of much comment lately. Orchestra
        leader are beginning to think that
        unless they feature that "Jazs Blues"
        they will not be popular. The young
        girl who attend these dance, ac
        cording to those who are best In
        formed are beginning to feel the same
        way. In other word, the danolng

        Dancing achool, "1 to have strict
        rule in these publlo places, and to
        have some one there to see that they
        are enforced." Mr. Wilson states
        that while the average person dances
        for the love of dancing, on the other
        hand there are some who dance only
        for the opportunity of coming In
        close contact with those of the op
        posite sex. For thin reason, Mr. Wll
        on ayi, the hugging and cheek-to-cheek
        dancing must go. He says
        that the time ha come when the
        people must take a stand against all
        !:lnd of (Immoral dancing. He
        print out that the lover of dancing
        do not necessarily have to go back
        to th ancient dancing, for the mod
        ern dances, If danced properly, are far
        more attractive and graceful. He
        state that even "the )nzz" fox trot
        with the tickle-toe can be danced In
        a moral way. But unfortunately the
        average young couple, he adds, danc
        ing the fox trot, very closely resemble
        Jclly-ln-a-bowl on a frosty morning.
        The dancing- master continued "Some
        of our best girls dance this way be
        cause they think It la 'stylish.' They
        mean absolutely no harm, but think
        to be popular they must rub all the
        skin oft the left side of their face
        against the wiry beard of some young
        man. How some people can dance
        all hugged up I past me; fact Is,
        they don't dance, they Just hop.
        Notice a couple of real dancer on
        exhibition, and you will see at least
        four Inches of space between them.
        That Is the real comfortable way to
        dance. You must be educated In
        proper dancing." x
        Warming to hi subject, Mr. Wil
        son says: "We appeal to mothers
        and chaperones to help us elevate
        dancing. We also appeal to musi
        cians. They do not realize how much
        help they can be. The way Is to cut
        out so much "Jazz" and play the
        muslo more like It Is written.

        if Dance Is to Be Artistio.
        people are demanding straight,
        smooth dancing, and they are going
        to have it. Six months ago we pre
        dicted that the dancing teachers' as
        sociation would wage war on "Jazz,"
        and our prediictlon has come true.
        We feel that we are giving the dance
        Ing public a warning1 of what Is to
        come If the social reformer and the
        preacher once start a war on danc
        ing. For as things exist now, they
        will certainly find good support.
        "We hope the dancers will take
        warning and not let the reformers
        find one chance to complain when
        they start. The good people can set
        the example and others can be forced
        to follow."

      <text>A Defense of Jazz
        Continued from Preceding Page.
        the waiter came and fanned me with the
        check. Then I passed out.
        When I came to I married Jessica and
        paid the check with her dowry.
        Was that immoral?
        Yet they say jazz is ruining the morals
        ?f our youth. In my thesis, which I shall
        submit to the Fellows of the Harvard and
        "V" 'i In pnrnni'i i inno ort/I m??la nf t
        Bryn Mawr and Vassar corporations, 1
        shall convince the world that jazz is justified,
        inevitable and harmless. I shall pepper
        the thesis with enough allusions in Latin
        to get it by as a thesis.
        My argument will be along the fol^wing
        lines, and see if you don't think there is
        some sense to it: These are parlous times.
        They are the times in which every good
        1
        If this was a slow age tl
        man should come to the aid of his country.
        Life is not the placid thing it was when
        women wore crinolines. Life could not be
        anything but placid with a crinoline
        around.
        (You understand this is all in outline,
        sort of.)
        The same thing applies to any of those
        getups the girls of ancient times used to
        rig themselves out in, for what reason I
        the stars alone know. Those twelfth cen- j
        tury effects with the stovepipe hats and
        nine or ten yards of gauze floating off
        them for no reason whatsoever. I refer to
        the headgear of the Sleeping Beauty period.
        Small wonder she went to sleep!
        And those Elizabethan ruffs. No wonder
        history states that Queen Elizabeth was
        straight laced. How could Sir Waiter
        Raleigh put his arm around her neck when
        it was alreadv done ud in enough ma
        terial to keep the Troy collar factories
        going a month?
        I shall go on to point out that modern
        life is essentially rapid and therefore essentially
        jazzy. I shall prove by actual
        statistics and charts that the slowest man
        in the United States to-day is seven and
        one-quarter times faster than the fastest
        man was when it took nine days to get
        from Boston to Philadelphia.
        And what is more, 1 guarantee to do
        this wunout masing a single jose aooui
        Philadelphia! Or Boston!
        The music of a period is a reflection
        of the mood of the time. If a people feeli
        jazzy they have jazz music and they live
        jazz lives, and the refined, moral peoplQ
        who are fortunately always in the minority,
        may denounce until they denounce
        themselves hoarse, but it will not do them
        any good. If a people feels minuettish; if
        circumstances are of a minuettish type,
        then you will find slow, stately music such
        as our ancestors of Colonial times had,
        when the fastest thing out was Paul Re- j
        vere.

        women, subways and a 75:25 standard of

        I admit that we would be better off
        without the radio concerts.
        Nevertheless, under these circumstances,
        who is going to dance the minuet today?
        Anyone suggesting such a thing
        would be and should be laughed to scorn.
        Jessica would not even dance a gavotte.
        and everyone knows there is an element
        of risk, of thrill in the gavotte. Your
        correspondent has seen men and women,
        cold sober, trip themselves or each other
        during a gavotte movement, and serious
        injury has ensued.
        If things ever slow down, and they
        never will, then jazz will go. but it never

        will. It is here to stay until we revert
        to type. That is why your correspondent
        feels sure that you would get a good
        laugh out of these clippings about jazz,
        wherein almost all of the dominies, lots
        of the dancing masters, and even Victor
        Herbert, attempt to take falls out of
        jazz. Their protests are futile and, incidentally,
        they arc all wrong because as
        Whatchacallit has 60 aptly said: "Whatever
        is, is right," and jazz certainly is,
        isn't it?
        Your correspondent has proved his case
        for jazz, and he hasn't even said a word
        about the war!</text>

        dying. Men have permitted themselves to be "partially killi'd." for the pur pose of
        Aescfihtag the sensation.-? which th^y experienced. They have tilled th-ir lungs with water.
        They have eaten of the llradlj poppjr. They have grasped the stinging electrode. And. last
        of all. they have tumbled into the subway. However the Bterchaats of this city may op pose
        an "open dit. h." there are many philo sophical citizens who regard it as a blessing. Here
        they are able with ease to make the plunge into the unknown themselves, or be A IIOIISE THAT

        phenomena, whkh are of the greatest value to psychology, and obtain data, for example, as to
        why an absent minded man fali-s into the subway head tirst. whereas t frightened woman
        simi>ly jumps in. According to the records of the BapM Transit Commission, there have been
        just nineteen men aril women who have tumbled into the subway since it was begun. There have
        also been thirty-two horses \vhi> h have either made a complete dt scent to the subway's
        bottom or partially made the leap. Numberless cats have tumbled into the great tr.-nc h, and
        several dogs have been made crazy by the bl.usting. In addi tion to the.se unfortunates,
        many H trkmites living in bOMK-ave assert that at one time they contracted the "subway
        knee," and that M of the Creqoent explosions of dynamite beneath their honic-s their legs
        had a tendency to double up. Although explosions and cave-Ins have some times LlUWll •.•ath,
        DeTerthetoM there has been a humorous H well as a pathetic side to the subway work. Ike

"Another wagoa knocked into the subway."
Should he he ensconced In his own ar:n chair,

he should be thrown halfway to the ceiling by a
sort of seismic sho>

        subway." Or at the club, if he is discussing the purity of politics with an Independent
        Democrat, and a rock should break into the room and his con versation, he might quietly
        remark: "Merely a high ball from the subway." On a Sunday, should this patient citizen at
        tend charcfa In upper Broadway, and the preacher should contrast the evil life with the good
        life, and should admonish his audience to chooae wisely in view of the consequences, and
        should go BO tar a.s to speak of the bottomless pit, there would be more than one mind In
        that church which would involuntarily think: "He meani the subway." Of .til the accidents
        that have come to the notice of the Rapid Transit Subway Construc tion Company there were
        none which evoked lea sadness than the ezpiosfoa which was al leged to hive driven a ball
        dozen dogs crazy. According to one story, the firing of a blast on Broadway, betw« n Long
        Acre Square and the cir l-\ shook up a woman's bird and animal store with such terrific
        violence that after she bad ta< rsett recovered from the shock she found
          one of the parrots, which had been a resident of
          i rh* ago, laying:
'T.ace t.; thee!"
Some Belgian hares w^r? so stunned that they
died, and the fear crossed the woman' s mind
          that if these had been the only Belgian hares In
          existence the species would have become ex
          tinct. But the maddest of an who lived in the
          block, po sh^ said, were a half doz<>n dogs. They kept digging as if to di« sUbwaj of their
        own. and in oth«r ways showed s!gns of mental at ■■r nition. The woman brought suit against
        the contractor for $50,000. In spite of all the erudition of physicians and Burgeons, there
        was nothing known of the "sub way knee" until the winter of 1901. At that time some of the
        residents of I^-nox-ave. com plained of a flexibility of the knee, which at times was
        disconcerting, if not dangerous. No matter what one's ideas on religious matters might be,
        he was likely at any time to get down on his knees as if in prayer. hould he per chance
        n.eet his debtor and see his opportunity of getting that $5,000 which he had long ago given
        up as lost, he might suddenly find the situation reversed, and himself instead of hi* debtor
        in an imploring attitude. The majority of those suffering from the "sub way knee" traced its
        origin to the frequent blasts in the subway In front of their homes. They said that the
        violent vibrations had loos ened their joints, and although they might have posed for more
        pious persons than they really were, nevertheless they preferred stiffer legs. They said
        they would even prefer a "house maid's knee" to a "subway knee" if they could only get it
        without being housemaids. At one time in Park How there was hardly a day that some horse did
        not put his foot through the planking of the wooden roof, or a wagon wheel did not sink in a
        crack, or both horse and wagon fall clear to the bottom of the trench. On May 8 of this year
        'here were two such accidents within a few hours of each other, and within a few feet of the
        same place. Near the bridge entrance a wagon broke through the subway roof, but the driver
        by leaping, was able to save the animals from fall ing through. Two hours before that 4.
        coal wagon had disappeared over the side of the subway in front of the Potter Building, and
        had been finally rescued by means of a hoisting engine and tackle. According to the
        contractor for the City Hall section of the subway, there have been eleven horses hauled out
        of the trench since it was first begun. One might think that a horse would be sure of
        serious injury from such a tumble. Yet some have had what seemed to be hairbreadth ex
        periences and escaped with only a few scratches^ A trolley car once bunteJ a team of horses
        at tached to an express wagon into .he subway in Fourth-aye. between Eleventh and Twelfth
        sts. One horse landed at the bottom with a single plunge, while the other caught its collar
        on a cross timber. The animal hung a moment in midair, then neatly slipped its head out of
        the collar* and landed on all fours. Both horses were hoisted out later by means of a sling

        tho subway constructed by contract and
        leased to the contractdr for-flfty yearn
        for nn annual rental of rather more than
        the interest payable by tho city on the

        be something more than a mere phrase
        when tho subway ls runnlng full-blast.
        It Is provlded by contract that local

        not less than fourteen mlles ,an hour.

        Close to the Surface.
        IJnllko most underground roads, the
        New York subway runs close to thesur
        fnce. Throughout most 'of-tho length
        fi-om the Battery to Harlem, lt ls only
        four or flve feet below the street levelj
        This makes tho excavation about twenty
        feet ln depth. and the 'platforms of the
        statlons are wlthin slxteen and elghteen
        f.-et of the surface. The steps down from
        the street to' the statlon are thus fewer
        in number, as a rule, than those. up to

      <text>Bacilli Invade the Subway
        DAKKXESS HIGHLY TAVOMABLB TO THEIR GROWTH
        THERE, ALL EXPERTS AGREE.
        Whether Passengers Get Enough Oxygen in Their Air Is a Disputed
        Point Which the City Is Xow Investigating.
        The air in New- York's $55.000.000 subway is already undergoing official investiga
        tion.
        Grarc charges are brought against it; the gravest perhaps being that the only fresh
        elr the subway can gt t is drawn almost entirely from the level of the streets.
        Tests made by the Street Cleaning Department show thai the air at the pavement lerel
        fairly recks with bacilli, and in some districts 9,600 colonies of them were found on a
        plate
        cf a few inches area at the end of fifteen minutes exposvrrc.
        The reason New-Yorkers can live in such an atmosphere is because sunlight kills
        these swarming bacilli.
        According ba the bacteriologist of the Health Department, bacteria will thrive es
        pecially well in the subway because of the lack of sunlight.
        The roadbed alongside the station platforms of the subway is believed by many ex
        perts to be a breeding place for bacteria, which are expectorated there by passengers
        waiting for trnins, and which, when the sputum dries, are caught up and thrown into the
        faces of crowds by the passing trains.
        The absolute necessity of adequate ventilation and sanitation is shown by an examina
        tion made of the cocoa mats on the floors of the elevated cars. One fibre only 1 inches
        long plucked from such a mat showed 4,000,000 bacilli of different sorts, which would
        breed consumption, pneumonia and grip, besides many more diseases. These mats get
        plenty of sunlight.
        The investigation of the Health Department may also discover that the subway air
        contains too much of the poisonous carbonic acid gas exhaled from the lungs of passen
        gers.
        Tests made by one expert showed that the subway contained more carbonic acid gas
        thin the electric subways of Boston, London or Paris. Another experiment, which, how
        ever, was attacked and called extravagant by a Columbia professor, showed that the sub
        vrr.x air was BO lacking in oxygen as to be positively dangerous.
        Paper pinwheels held in the subway entrances last week showed that, in spite of the
        complaints of stagnant air, passing trains drew in and threw out strong currents of air.
        Employes of the subway said they had not noticed any ill effects from breathing its
        atmosphere day after day.
        Our authority 6'iid be thought the electricity in the subway might purify the air to
        gome extent by the creation of ozone.
        Alexander E. Orr, president of the Rapid Transit Commission, said that the engineer
        ing department of that commission would plin new means of ventilation, and the operat
        ing company would pay for them, in case the subway was found unhealthful.
        I". P. Kryan, vice-president of the operating company, said that it would remedy any
        proved defed in the subway.
        The experts who discuss the subject of subway ventilation for The Tribune, and whose
        views are given below, include Dr. George A. Soper, Charles H. Myers. Samuel Whinery
        ;md H. Waller Brinckerhoff, civil engineers and members of the special commission em

        I'niversity; Professor Albert Spice, of Cooper Institute; Professor R. Ogden

        id of the chemistry department; Dr. August Seibert. a physician; Dr. Herman M.

      <text>The Subway Smokers Little Patience V* M Be Displayed with Them. H. V»'«;>r Brtekerhost,
        a. c'rll engineer, said that the of the subway will v* worse in MJWtner than In winter. "In
        cold Breather." be f^M. "the sir of the under ground res is srarmer than that In the street,
        and aoosrdtegly lias a tendency to rise. This la evident :o any one srbo enters the. subway.
        Against his forehead he will feel a draught of warm atmos phere c^r^lng up from below, and
        on reaching the platform cf the subway station and putting his hand down near the BOOT be
        will be able to notice a current of DOM air coming from the stairway. "In warmer seasons of
        the year, however, there will be bo such draughts and counter draughtf. Then the air of the
        subway will be colder than the itsnoophere outside, and it will "Imply lie inside. Being
        heavier than the warm air outride, it will seek as low a level a* possible. The trains may
        ntlr it up. but as to whether they will be capable of forcir.g It out through the entrances
        or not I cannot pay. "I hay. ridden m the subway, and. although I h; iV e smell of and paint
        and new ma*O7.: tot i. »tice the oppressiveness of a too laree ar.-,ount of carbonic acid
        gas. Noverthe le?s. I k: s-.v .-f cases whete persons have been af fecte-i. I have a friend
        who is an invalid, and who tells me he cannot rid' In the subway without a certain sense of
        suffocation. "It is lor this reason that I have been led to think that there will i- need of
        better means of ventilation tlian now employed, I do not think the mere lUtftemeat of trains
        over four parallel tracks, two up and two down, with no partitions between, •will be
        suihcieni. The air forced ahead by one train is thus thrown bacK by the train which passes
        it ••A partition between the two uptown and the two downtown tracks, however, would solve
        this difficulty. Then the trains would carry large volumes sir along with them, und in
        parsing etati-ins woui'J force it out through lie openings to the street. Such a partition
        could be built without lyir.ti up the operation of trains. That it would better atmospheric
        conditions m the suuway 1 have not the sligb doubt. "There ,s another thing which should be
        em phasized, and that is the tobacco nuisance in the subway. RsSxoos of the road should not
        be per iritled to smoke in the stations. It is not only un *ieplihful. but ii is grossly
        offensive to a great ma; y persoji.s. I have seen "a man light a cigarette While waiting for
        a car and then putt great clouds of smoke isitc tiie faces of women. Oftentimes the smoker
        'lid not realize, what be was doing. He might be standing with his back to those he was <the fumes ut tobacco oxer hie shoulder and Into
          th"ir fares. On entering a station I have often
cneountfred a sort of mist which to me proved
especially disagreeable.
" Most smokers spit, and In this they menace the
          health of fellow passengers. You m^v see scores
          «>f
        them standing on the platform of a* station and i.tid with broken stone and has not a smooth
        sur .»cp, thrre is bo way of washing away the forms of po.luuoD that may fall there.
        Consequently. the f-putuin dries, and then is forcibly thrown about in the air by the
        rushing trains. "I hear that certain citizens are about to make a formal request of the
        operating company for smok ing cars. Tnis would be adding insult to injury. I r.avo no
        patience with h. man v.-ho cannot wait ten of twenty minutes without blowing smoke out of
        n's mouth. dr: chandlers tests. A Demonstration of the Way He Will Make Them. Professors
        Charles F. Chandler and Charles teHew, of Columbia, are already at work mak ing an official
        analysis of the air of the subway for the Health Department. They -will conduct their tests
        tor some weeks, and will examine the air at many different points along- the road and under
        as many conditions as possible. On the result of their work much depends. Before making this
        official analysis, however. Professor Chandler, with the assistance of Pro feesor Pellew,
        had already made some tests, and, although they had not brought their in vestigation to
        exact results. Professor Pellew consented yesterday to discuss the work. He also talked at
        some length concerning: the tests of Dr. Stlbert. and said they «er« grossly In correct.
        According to the results of Dr. Rei berfs experiments, he added, the air of the sub v.ay
        would kill men as poison does flies. "Dr. BetberV he said, "makes th» statement that
        scientific instruments do not lie. A'ell. so far I agree with htm; but it's the man behind
        the instrument, like the man behind the gun, whose skill decides the result. Now, at the
        subset of his remarks Dr. Setbert admits that he was .-it leus-i 1 per cent off in his test
        of the normal amount of oxygen in ordinary air; It Isn't necessary for scientific
        Instruments to lie to that extent la this experiment. The air that you breathe fiom your
        lung's contains between 17 and 18 per cent of oxygen. Dr. Seibert, in testing subway air.
        found only 11 per cent In pome places. In such an atmosphere you couldn't light match, a
        cigarette would go out, fir*- extinguishers would be useless, for Maine couldn't live, and a
        smoking: car would be a Joke. "Whir, your atmosphere gets down so' bad that there is only 19
        per cent of oxygen, it Is a MMBSMSj to tho.se breathing it, and below that It WOOld kill
        people in less than five minutes. That is Ij 8 per cent b»-low the normal. When you pet V>
        per oent below it you can see the eituatir';'. Where oould jrou get It? Not from the air
        breathed from the lungs, for that has afeetat 18 per cent. Compare the subway with the old
        underground road* in Ixmdon. There ou have steam engin< -s burning coaL The tun
nel 5s fu'.i of g;ts and smokr. but you don't hear
of jeaths. The Park-aye. tunnel is the same to
ut in the ?übway you have no
coal
"I am now at work on experiments on the sub
way air. I haven't worked out any figures yet.
But. though I have been through the subway
many time* to test this. I haven't found bad
air, except in crowded cars. Then I opened a
window jind the air was fresh. 1 don't beliave,
that th*re is any need (or other ventilation or
that the air is bad, but that remains to be de
termined. The number of people to any given
mile Is small; there re currents of air from
the trains steadily: It Is a fairer comparison to
compare with a number of people running
through the tunnel, rather than with the same
number in any room. 01 course, that is entirely
apart from the question of the amount of oxy
gen in the subway air, as Dr. Seibert explained
It."
Prof' "i- Peilew then I sowed his apparatus
for deters, Jnir.g the percentage of oxygen and
jTefTormed the experiment of testing the amount
of oxygen In air breathed from his lungs by way
of Illustrating. He used the Hempel apparatus,
mid the experiment, stripped of its technical
terms. was as follows. Processor Pellew first
filled an ordinary large tent tube with water
and fixed stopcocks at each ci.a. Then he took
a deep breath, put one cud of the tube to hie
luouth a:>d breathed into It. This, of course,
        expelled the water like a squirt gun. and the :nlnute the wat«-r was out he snapped the atop
        cocks at each enfl. The water was put In tint to expel the air that originally filled the
        tube. v.hleh of course, that of the room. Thus lie secured a supply of air from his lungs to
        Lest. The next step was to secure a measured quantity of air to enable him to get a basis of
        calculation. To do this lie tilled with water a graded test tube, which had the metric ijyan
        titative measurements from 1 to 100 Indicated -on it. Next be attached one end of this test
        lube to that containing the supply of air. The other end of the tube full of air he attached
        to a vessel of water; then by water pressure he iorced the air in the original tube Into the
        graded tube, the air in turn expelled the water, and when the last drop of water was gone he
        had a measured quantity of hit Bar his e.xperl p'«nt. Tht-n the tube containing the air
        sup;-.y was removed, after the Ftopoocks on the graded tube had been closed, and the same
        degrpr- of water pressure once more applied, making an absolute linlejli a between the air
        in the tube and the. water. Professor Pfilovc w"A^ ready to test the air As the air waf
        riimirished In quantity, the water Id the eotmaetmg tube, -which now just balanced the" air.
        wou'rt flow In to take Its place. At the start, when there was no water in th« imuted tube.
        any rise; of the water could be measured by the gradations on the side, and would show a
        corresponding decrease of air. The first step in -th* experiment required the elimination of
        the" carbonic; acid pas In th" air, f\v.rp it would affect the later procoßde.x. Pro fessor
        Pellew noted at. this stage th;.t^ Dr. Hel bert omitted to mention any such step. To do
        this, one end of the graded tube was attached to the Hompei uitus, a mystifying com blnation
        of giasa bulbs; in which sections of air and water were maintained at a balance. The weipli#
        of the water at the other end of the graded tube was then Increased. This forced the
        measured supply of air out of the graded tube Into the Hempel apparatus. In this it
        gradually Bowed Into a solution of caustic pot ash, which :;t once- absorbed the carbonic
        acid. Then the water pressure was removed and the air Rowed back into the graded lube until
        the old s^iito of balance in the Hempe! apparatus was reprainvd. Then it was seen that the
        water had crept up the (traded tube shid taken the place occupied .by the carbon!*; acid
        gas. which had been exhausted. About 2 per cent of Water had been admitted, showing that
        about '1 per cent of carbonic acid gas had been present in the air from the lungs. Precisely
        the same process was now repeated, the only diKemce being that instead of forcing the air
        into contact with a solution of caustic potash it was forced into another bulb contain ing
        bright yellow phosphorus. Instantly the yellow phosphorus became cloudy, and the ac tion on
        it by the air was visible. As soon as it cleared it was a signal that the oxygen had been
        absorbed by the phosphorus. Once more the pressure was drawn off. until the balance was once
        more reached In the Hempel apparatus. This time It was clear that there had been a
        considerable reduction in th«» air quantity, for, with the same balance of liquids, the
        water crept up in th? graded tube above the 20 mark. After the deduction of the amount of
        carbonic acid gas which the earlier process had elimi nated, the result showed that the air
        from Pro fessor Pellew's lungs had contained lS^i per cent of oxygen, or nearly 8 per cent
        more than Dr. Peibert found In some of the subway sta tions. He then said: "A closer and
        more careful experiment, ac complished when you breathed and held your nose closed, to
        eliminate any influence of the outside air, would show that the air from the bottom of the
        lungs had something over 17 per cent of oxygen. Now. that is precisely the way* I shall test
        the subway air. Except, of course, that in getting the air to test I'll take my tube full of
        water down In the subway and then let the water run out. Of course, subway air will flow In,
        and then closing the stopcocks, will confine It."</text>

        ALL TO BE OPERATED BY iTERBOROUGH
        FOR A SINGLE S CEiT
        If V--. X A
        m m (CV 4 11 S J x U
        The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company Offers to Reduce Fares to Manhattan at the City's
        Expense, But Refuses to Reduce Fares to Coney Island at that Company's Expense.
        This map shows what the Interborough Company has offered to
        the City as a comprehensive subway plan. The lines shown in heay
        broken lines can be immediately constructed and placed in opera
        tion for a single five-cent subway fare in connection with the present
        subway, the bridge Loop, and the Fourth Avenue Subway. The total
        construction cost will be $198,788,650, of which the City pays
        $110,320,150 for construction and the Interborough $88,478,500. The
        Interborough supplies all of the equipment, which makes a total
        contribution by the Interborough of $140, 824, SCO. The City's expen
        diture under this plan is $58,000,000, leas than called for by the
        Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company's plan.
        The Interborough's plan establishes a universal five-cent subway
        fare from Fort Hamilton, Coney Island. Shetpihead Bay, East New
        York. Ridgewood, Wocdside, Coona, Astoria and all parts of the
        Bronx. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company's plan establishes a
        ten-cent fare within the Greater City ard for a great many of the
        people in Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx a fii teen-cent fare to
        Coney Island. The Brooklyn Company claims that it will make a
        great saving to Brooklyn people by extending its lines into Manhat
        tan, thus avoiding a double fare.
        The Interborough Company, by going to Brooklyn for the
        people with its numerous lines with a single fare, save more then
        the Brooklyn Company claims to save, because on the Interborough
        there will be a single fare to reach from every point in Brooklyn to
        every point in Greater New York.
        If the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company is so interested in re
        ducing the expenditures of the fare-payer, why do they insist in
        A their proposition that for a short ride from Brooklyn to Coney
        '""'md the lare must be ten cents
        The Interborough has adopted the principle that a single five
        cent fare paid on the subway system shall carry a person from one
        end to the other of the Greater City of New York. On the other
        hand, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company's plan proposes to
        perpetuate a two-and three-fare system.
        The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company's proposal is that it will
        spend less than $21,000,000 for construction in improving its eleva
        ted lines in Brooklyn and placing third tracks thereon if the Greater
        City of New York will pay about $168,000,000 of the taxpayers' money
        for subway construction and connect it with the out-of-date eleva
        ted lines in Brooklyn, provided further that all the receipts on the
        Subways built by the taxpayers' money shall be used by the Brooklyn
        Rapid Transit Company in establishing for all time a dividend on
        many of the unprofitable elevated lines in Boooklyn.
        The Interborough's plan proposes to extend the present City
        Subway so that all the people in Brooklyn, including the outlying
        districts, will be given a five-cent subway fare from one end to the
        other ofthe Greater City of New York. If the Interborough's plan is
        adopted by the City it will save $58,000,000 of the taxpayers' money
        that the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company's plan calls for, and this
        $58,0C0,000, will construct the lines shown on this map to Rich
        mend, to Jamaica and to Flushing, and if these lines are construc
        ted there would still be $30,000,000 of the taxpayers' money saved by
        accepting the Interborough's plan.
        The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Co. advertises that it will take only
        $73,500,000 of City money to construct the rapid transit lines which
        it has been showing in heavy black lines on its advertising maps.
        The misleading character of this talk about cost can be seen read
        ily by lookinar at its offer of April 25th. in which it was stated that
        the City's requirement of new capital would be $73,500,000 for the
        lines then proposed.
        Since that date and on May 1st the Brooklyn Company added
        to its so-called original lines:
        1. The Jerome Avenue extension to Jerome Park Reservoir.
        2. The Southern Boulevard extension to the Bronx River.
        3. Lines to Astoria and Corona.
        4. The Nostrand Avenue extension.
        5. The Livonia Avenue extension; and
        6. The Fourteenth Street Tunnel to East New York.
        But not a word has been said about the additional cost of these
        lines. Every day since they were added the Brooklyn Company has
        stuck to its original figure of $73,500,000. More than this, and still
        further showing the deceptiveness of their advertisements, the
        Brooklyn Company are placing upon their advertising maps in black
        lines the following lines which they have riot even yet agreed to put
        in their offer:
        a i The Southern Boulevard line extending as far as Pelham
        Bay Park.
        (b) The Utica Avenue extension; and
        (c) The Tunnel to Staten Island.
        And still they seek to lead the public to believe that all the black
        lines will cost the city only $73,500,000.
        Now the facts are that the cost to the city of the lines first
        mentioned by them will be $118,000,000.
        The cost to the city, with their additions of May 1st, will run
        up to $168,000,000.
        The grand total cost to the city of their layout as advertised
        will run up to $188,500,000.

        We know what a stimulus Ihe existing

        When the existing subway was built
        its two branches in 'Ihe lirnux, viz., the
        Broadway division und the Iamiox avenue
        division, projected largely into unde
        veloped territory A study of the real
        estate vulues of vacant lots in this terri
        tory for the year louo, four years prior
        to the opening of the subway, shows the
        increase in valuations brnuuht about by
        t lie opera; ion of the subwuy Comparison
        of these values with Ihe assessed valua
        tions in 1907, a little more than two years
        alter the subway begun operation, shows
        Mil astounding increase In the territory
        opened up bv the Broadway brunch
        valuations between Kt.'tli street and
        spuyten Duyvil from iwmto Itw; increased 1
        about MtCluo.tiOo. 'I lie normal increase of i
        he previous seven years was estimated
        .it lhO.000, which, subtrai ted I rum ihe
        IW7 valuations, shows the increase due'
        to the building of the Midway to have

        the previous seven years was estimated
        at JlU.WO.OOO, this showed an increase of
        XII.SW.ooo apparently duo to Ihe building
        of the subwuy. 1 nee no reason why a
        similar increase in values should not
        billow the opening up of the dual system
        in undeveloHid or partially developed
        sections.
        1 am glad to be able to state that con
        struction work on the dual system is pro
        gressing rapidly. There is now under con
        t met ion newly $eo,0oo,ouo worth of work
        nail before the new year is two months
        old this total will be increased to more
        than HOO.OUO.OOO. This means that more
        than half of the work which the City of
        Vw York is to puy for in I lie new system
        is already under contract. This work is
        being done by eighteen different con
        tractors who employ all told a daily force
        ol about 7,000 men. For tho year 101S up
        'o tho 15th of December the City of New
        nrk had paid these contractors a total of
        nearly $15,000,000, so that the new work
        i- already putting into circulation more
        i ha u $!,noo,00n of new money every month
        I he average expenditure for 1014 will be
        e en larger, so thut the construction of
        this groat work is already proving on im
        portant factor in tho employment of labor
        and tho promotion of the general pros
        perity. While the dual system will extend rapid
        transit facilities lo many undeveloped
        sections, it will also relieve present con
        '.Mioii in most of Ihe developed portions
        of the city. Even streets in the old city
        ol Vow York, away down in the financial
        district or Manhuttan, will be tunnelled
        to miiliu space for the tracks which will
        i.njiat.i under rivers and over miles of
        and to tho remotest districts of Brooklyn.
        Queens and The Hronx. The system will
        have two grand divisions, one to be oper
        ated by the Jnterboroush lUpid Transit
        i ompany and the other by the New York
        Municipal Hallway Corporal ion. Iu tho

        Brooklyn, and a connection with tho ex
        isting subway near Borougii Hull, Brook
        lyn, The subway which now ends at
        Flatbush and Atluntio avenues will also
        be extended out Flatbush avenue to
        Eastern Parkway uud through Eastern
        Parkway to Buffalo uvenue. This will bo
        a four track road. 1'rom Buffalo fcvenUe
        au extension will be built thiough Kasi
        Ninety-eighth street to blvonia avenue
        and out blvonia avenue to New Lots road.
        This extension will be a three track line.
        Front this brief sketch of the routes it
        will be seen that the additions lo t ,ie exist
        ing subway will more than double lt
        pie-ent facilities, By the building of the
        Lexington avenue line north or Forty
        second street and joining It to the e: isting
        subway south or thut street the 'liter
        borough will have for operation n com
        plete, four track lino up and down the
        The Spirit of New York
        East Side from Brooklyn Bridge to the
        Ifnrlem Hiver. Similarly by building the
        Seventh uvenue subway south of Forty
        second street und attaching it to the
        existing subwuy in Broudway north of
        that street the company will have a com
        plete West Side lino from I'ark place to
        Ninety-sixth street. Instead of having
        four trucks bet weed Brooklyn Bridge
        and Ninety-sixth street, us ut present,
        the now system, therefore, will have eight
        truoks between those points, practically
        a duplication of tho existing subwuy.
        In 'I'he Bronx ihe existing brunches of
        the subway have only two trucks each,
        although in places there are three tracks,
        but for operating purposes ihey may be
        considered two truck lines As Ih.i now
        line up Jerome avenue and the new lino
        out .Southern Boulevard und Westchester
        avenue will have three tracks each, It is
        apMirent that these two branches of the
        Lexington uvenue subway alone will nunc
        than double Ihe present subway facilities
        lu The Bronx, lu uddition, however, Ihe
        dual system plans ,i for the extension
        or tiie Lenox avenue branch of the exist
        ing subway from isuih stieet out White

        Extensions to the elevuted railroads
        operulod by the luterliorough Company
        will further amplify the facilities of those
        important agencies of transportation. At

        will be used jointly by elevated uud bub

        on tho West Side elevated roads will bo
        enabled lo go from downtown .Mauliatlun
        to Woodlawn roud without chanvnof cars.
        Of the East Side elevated roads the

        I necessity for switching express trains lo
        the local tracks south of Forty-second is
        one of the grout defects of present opera
        tion. Under the dual system this wilt be
        remedied by the extension of the third
        track from Forty-second street down to
        City Hall There will also be a third track
        added to the Second avenue line for its
        entire length below the Harlem River
        The Third avenue line will be third tracked
        also ucross the Harlem and as far as Pel-

        I'liiin- road, where a junction will be made
        witli the extension of tho Lenox avenue
        I subway to 311st street. This extension,
        like -loroiiip avenue, will lie used jointly by
        subway ami elevated truins. so that when

        which up to the present time lids never
        enjoyed rapid transit except such as is
        possible through the Pennsylvania tun-

        in Long Islund City to the Queensboro
        Bridge plaza. This extension also will
        join the new Queens lines so that tho ln

      <text>Serious Smash-Up in New York Subway Tunnel
        New York, Sept 29. One of the
        most serious accidents in the his
        tory of the New York subway sys
        tem occurred early today when two
        trains collided underneath 142d st,
        the Bronx.
        Three men received injuries which
        are expected to prove fatal. The
        trains took fire and, in fighting the
        flames, 20 firemen were overcome by
        the dense smoke which choked the
        tunnel. 100 passengers on a train
        following those which collided were
        thrown into a panic and fought the
        guards until the doors were opened.
        They then walked seven blocks back
        through the smoke-filled tunnel.
        The injured men are all subway
        employes They were removed to the
        Fordham Hospital There it was stat
        ed that they had a small chance for
        recovery.</text>

        WHAT WAS THE CAUSE-THEN7
        Three physicians sard that Albert
        $nd Joseph KIrsch, three and two
        years old, had ded of ptemaine poi
        soning anxl attributed it to the ice
        cream which their father had bought
        .them at a store at 2452 Cortez st
        An inspector .from the health de
        partment took a sample of the cream.
        Several days later Kirsch visited tp.e
        city hall to find out the outcome''of
        the test He was told the sample had
